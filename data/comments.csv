This is a highlight from the 11th iteration of major tournament of the game by Valve, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. This is the Grand Final match and 3rd and final map between Gambit and Immortals. Dosia from Gambit, damages steel and LUCAS1 from Immortals by an HE grenade. The result of this is that they die to the bomb explosion. The bomb explosion has a damage radius that decreases with distance. Normally if the players stay at the end of pit in that map (where steel and LUCAS1 were) then the player survives if they have close to a full HP. But this grenade by dosia damages them enough so that they die to the explosion.

Dying in the round means that they lose all the utility and guns that they had on them that round. Gambit is already at 9 rounds to 1 round of Immortals during that time and Gambit were losing that round anyway, hence those 2 immortals players dying meant a loss of economy going into the next round. This adds to the significance of this play. Also many users here and the casters agree that we have never seen such use of an HE grenade over the years. It is an extremely smart play.

Each map is Best of 30 rounds, so first team to reach 16 wins. 15 rounds on each side, terrorists and counter terrorists. After the half the teams switch roles. **Another thing to note is that only us, the viewers, see the blue/yellow outlines surrounding the players.

Hi! Welcome to /r/GlobalOffensive, the subreddit for the latest Counter Strike game by Valve. You know, the game you used to play at your cousin Billy's in 2002. Yeah that one. Anyway:

ESL, one of the largest esports tournament organisers, have announced today that they are lifting some previous 'lifetime' bans imposed on players who were caught cheating and match fixing.

This includes the iBUYPOWER squad who were caught match fixing and uncovered by journalist Richard Lewis (you can find more information on that [here](http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2015/01/11261/)). Previously, this highly praised North American lineup had been lifetime banned by Valve (the creators of CSGO) from attending their premiere tournaments. Organisations like ESL, who host these after tendering with Valve, copied their move in banning them likewise in order to keep consistent.

This news now means that the players of that squad, some of whom are still seen as top American talent ([e.g. Brax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQCFkalXd80)) can now join and participate in teams during ESL's leagues and events. This still excludes him from Valve premiere events, as Valve have not lifted any bans themselves.

For further context, 'IBP' and 'FreeSwag' spam/memes still takes up a healthy chunk of spam we get to the subreddit, despite it happening in early 2015.

Some of you may be wondering why this is significant and so highly upvoted, and I'll try to briefly explain:

World of Warcraft is very old, by videogame standards.  It was released in 2004.  And about every two years, Blizzard releases a new expansion to update the game.  Typically expansions don't really *replace* content, but it does *displace* it, and changes to mechanics and player abilities are indeed permanent and ""retroactive"".  And in 2010, the *Cataclysm* expansion DID actually replace the old content from the release game.

So for almost a decade, players have been asking for Blizzard to re-release the original ""Vanilla"" server and re-release earlier pre-Cataclysm expansions.  This has been a fairly large point of contention in the community, with many, many players playing on ~~""illegal""~~ [*unauthorized*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7aljfu/world_of_warcraft_classic_announcement/dpb8umm/) private servers that tend to get shutdown from time to time by Blizzard.  Blizzard, for their part, said they'd look into rebuilding Classic servers about a year or so ago, and it looks like they're finally delivering, with this announcement that significant resources are being put into development.

There's obviously more to the history of this topic than that, but hopefully that gets you started.

EDIT: To address the person who deleted their comment but had a fair point:

>Why is illegal in quotes? It's not really a grey area.

>>I mean, it's *certainly* a TOS violation, and they've used Cease & Desist for IP violations to (arguably rightfully) shut down private servers, but also, we're dealing with international laws between countries here, so that complicates it.

Dota 2 is a free to play game created by Valve Software based on the Warcraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients (DotA) which was released around 2003/2004. DotA is also a game that many other popular MOBAs took inspiration from (League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Smite). The game is a 5 vs 5 game in which each player chooses to play 1 of 112 unique Heroes, each having their own unique abilities and techniques. Dota 2 has a very strong Esports following, having numerous international tournaments throughout the year, the most recent one being Valve's Boston Major, which concluded a few hours ago.

Dota has had many patches over the years, starting from 0.95 to 3.XX, 4.XX and so on. The first 6.XX installment was released in 2005, more than a decade ago. All patches since then have followed the 6.XX numbering.

The last major gameplay update, 6.88, was April 25th this year.

Everyone has been eagerly awaiting this patch, as it also marks the addition of the first hero not present in the original Dota mod, Monkey King. We all expected the patch to be called 6.89 and shake up the game but **IT'S GOING TO BE FUCKING _7.00_. SO MUCH IS GOING TO CHANGE HOLY SHIT**

We need to let Bungie know, even if it feels like they won&#39;t care.  </p>

What could we do instead?

It's easy to say ""why do you have to be hardasses about memes, don't over complicate it"" - and you would be somewhat right, my ass *is* pretty hard about this kind of stuff - but the core of the problem is, some people want them and some other people *really don't*.

In the past, we've tried both ""allow almost anything"" ***and*** ""be super strict and allow almost nothing"", and in *both* cases the userbase was upset.  Different people want different things, and it basically comes down to a question of ""who do we want to piss off?"" which obviously isn't exactly a fair choice.

To try and reconcile these two groups, we tried meeting in the middle - [have a sliding scale of what is allowed vs. what isn't](https://imgur.com/kDjWgB8).  A few people are upset that a rule about something silly is taken so seriously, but most of the time it works out OK.  Recently, there's been a massive uptick in TF2 based memes on Reddit and elsewhere, which has lead to us having to remove an above average amount of low effort posts, which has caused a spike in hostilities between users and the mods.  There are *many* other subreddits for this kind of content with varying degrees of activity, like /r/tf2memes, /r/tf2shitposterclub, /r/givemeinteligens, /r/gocommitfortress2, /r/sentryhurtingjuice, /r/tf2circlejerk, /r/truetruetf2, /r/tf2animemes - honestly, I could probably add another 20 entries to this list, but I think you get the point.  Most people congregate at the first two (/r/tf2shitposterclub and /r/tf2memes), which is probably for the best - splintering the community into a million tiny pieces is a great way to get it to die out all together - but these other subs still exist, among a couple hundred other TF2 related subreddits, and some of them still get content every once in a while.

But back to the main point:  We can't please everyone at once, but we can at least get close by trying to compromise on the rules.  An announcement containing the results to the poll, updated rules, and some other bits of news is coming soon (and no, not Soon™, *actually soon*, within a week or so), and one of the things that is going to be changed is how we handle memes.  **I'll give a little information right now, because I think we could use some feedback before making it final:**

There will be one day a week on which we allow practically *all* memes, most likely Sunday.  This means that if you *really* wanna shitpost here, you can - it just has to be on a specific day of the week.  Additionally, there will be one *other* day a week where we allow *no* low effort content at all, which includes regular screenshots and most memes.  *This* day will most likely be Saturday and is intended to give content creators and those wanting more discussion time in the spotlight.  There will be an infographic explaining this, while also more clearly defining what counts as ""low-effort"" while having (hopefully) no discretion at all.

Yesterday a developer on the ArenaNet's narrative team, Jessica Price, made [[this comment]](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1014554296107483136) when a Youtuber/Streamer (who is in the official ArenaNet partnerprogram) Deroir gave his take on the topic of player character design in Guild Wars 2 after Price was not pleased with comments in AMA posted earlier here.

Her reply can be taken as falsely claiming that Deroir only left this comment because she is a female developer. Deroir replied that it was not his intentions, but the discussion didn't care and rest you can view in her Twitter page. She also made [[rude remarks]](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1014555719352213504) towards Deroir and was generally [[unhappy towards the people]](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1014581433937981445) who made comments in the discussion she didn't like. 

Also during this ""incident"" another developer, also in the story side, Peter Fries replied to Price's comments saying that she was in the right, that it was indeed sexism. ~~Both have now apparently possibly been fired from their job (no official notice).~~ Two people are no longer with the company, but there is no official statement on who these two were.

I lost my first guild wars 2 account due to hacking/changing phone numbers/ex bfs and things went a little screwy. So I quit for almost a year.

My close friend convinced me to buy another account to play with him and some old guildies and new friends. He introduced me to his friend and we hit it off doing jumping puzzles. I completely suck at them but he has the patience of a saint!

We chatted over voice comms for a few days. I swear the moment I heard his voice I knew he was the one. (He doesn't believe me 😂) We realized we were close enough to drive to one another he decided to drive to me and meet me IRL.

I haven't looked back from that day. It's been four years and yesterday we got married.

We are so thankful for gw2 and the community. We are hooked on this game and continue to play together.

Thank you for reading! ❤️
