"I would say they are probably running a density analysis of some type on the footprint data in this context. You could theoretically say a given cell is x% covered by building, or you could look at it as a concentration of buildings (regardless of size, just the number) within a cell.

As for why it matters, you need to understand the implications of vector / raster conversion. Let's say a building falls in two cells, but it's 80% in one of them and 20% in the other. As far as the raster is concerned, the cell with 80% is building and the cell with 20% is not. This is fundamentally what happens when you rasterize those buildings, and is different than if you're working with a vector grid where you can preserve the relative ratio no matter how small.

Go up a level. Let's say a cell has a number of buildings in it, but even all put together they aren't more than 50% of the cell. Again, that cell is not building as far as the raster is concerned. You can generate a new raster at the same cell size as your parent raster whose values are what percentage of that cell are covered by a rasterized version of the footprints, but that's going to depend on the resolution those footprints are rasterized to (ie, the sampling rate). And if a building falls in two cells, you can't just take that footprint's area and do anything with the cell area, you first have to apportion the footprint's total area to each cell before summing up all footprint areas within the cell to *then* divide by the cell area for a ratio (which would be considerably easier just sticking with vector)."

"I did 12 days 7 years ago. 

I was fine after the third day. 

I would collect food I craved for after my fast. That was dumb. None of it was healthy and none felt as good as promised when I was still craving it. 

I would get really random cravings from day 5-11. Like food I hadn't eaten in years.  I assume it was from the fat cells being emptied out. Like a fat memory lol. 

None were overwhelming or made me want to eat. They just existed for a few minutes at a time. 

I stopped my fast with very diluted vegetable juice (carrot and apple). 1/4 cup vj + 3/4 water sipped very slowly. Then two hours later I would have 1/2 vj + 1/2 water. Then eventually a whole cup. Just a way to wake the digestive system. I stuck to raw and cooked veggies day 1-2 of eating and then incorporated light carbs and protein day 3-4. All in all, the worst thing was trying any junk food before the first week of eating again was done. I felt like I was gonna die. I switched over to omad after my fast. 

Another thing. I didn't experience any sort of minerał deficiency until day 6 when I started experiencing orthostatic hypotension upon standing up. That would be the day that small amounts salt was required."

"He made zero statements about Insulin being abused, you attacked his statement by declaring that it is wrong. The only thing he asserted was that we have long since mastered producing insuline at an industrial level, that there is no added R&amp;D cost for producing this routine to manufacture the drug, that there is no outcome where you will die on an operating table which would be cause for malpractice. The assertion was that it is done because drug companies are being greedy which they are. 

Nothing that was stated by the OP was false, you projected a falsehood onto the statement for whatever reason you chose to spew it. And now you're demanding that they show you where they implied in their statement was about diabetic's taking insulin and not who else could abuse it.

Yeah no that's not how things work, if your going to try to twist things into your stupid narrative you have to show where it was ever implied in the original statement that they were not referencing Diabetics, who make up the vast majority of use cases for Insulin wasn't who they were referring to. And not your stupid fringe case example of muscleheads killing themselves by taking something that isn't prescribed to them.

If you can't do that then apologize and leave the conversation."

"But the real difference isn't on paper, it's on the pitch. Barca have many players with reps that don't hold up. Truthfully put, Suarez isn't just not what he used to be, he's consistently been a liability on these occasions. Dembele isn't just injured, he's inconsistent in his decision making and final product. Busquets isn't the goat he's made out to be. Rakitic no longer strikes me as a key player, more serviceable etc. Wjnaldum

Most importantly, Liverpool are mentally and tactically leagues ahead. Going into the tie I said I doubt this Barca side could beat Liverpool over the 2 legs. Barcelona got pumeled 4-0 away from home against a side without their two best forwards. It's embaressing but it's nothing new. They were embaressed last year and the year before that. Last night wasn't the anomaly, last week was. Barca just ain't that good right now. Good enough to walk the league sure, but where is the competition? 3 seasons now we've seen they can't rely on Messi to carry them through big European ties."

"I had to pump exclusively for 10 weeks before I could get a good latch. Just because you cannot breastfeed now, doesn't mean you never will. Use slow flow nipples, look up paced bottle feeding, and try not to beat yourself up. When your baby's mouth gets bigger, latching may get better. You have to do so many tricks in the beginning because babies aren't guaranteed to be great at latching right away and their mouths are tiny and they are just running on instinct. Let your nipples heal and pump for now to maintain supply."
"So we have come full circle. You are now arguing that US elites ""sold out"" the lower classes in order to enrich themselves, not ""help us."" Guess what, I agree with that. But the significant connection here is that this is and has always been the foundation of free market capitalism. Your beef is not with China, but with the system that produced China. Concepts like fair wages, labor unions, etc., are only possible when profit seeking is regulated and curtailed for the benefit of the whole. That is, *when the government intervenes in the market*. 

As far as why countries didn't move into India or Brazil... What makes you think they didn't? Did you look at the bilateral trade and investment between India and Japan, Brazil and the US, South Korea, etc.? China was more profitable because its government was more competent at mobilizing the work force and creating business friendly environments, but that didn't make it the only game in town. Out sourcing to India, Brazil, etc. was happening before China, continued to happen in spite of China, and is still happening.

"Agreed, and the general BO1 format favors upsets/underdogs, at least in the single game-aspect. 

Obviously as C9 fan, I'd like to see them win more BO3's and go to more real LANs, but at this point, Blast is even messing with C9's opportunity to get more spotlight to play and actually compete; as this weekend is ESL Cologne's America qualifier, and C9 is missing that for Blast. I would call this moreso a sign of the negative effects Blast has not only on top teams, but it's seeping down to lower teams.

At the same time, Blast is also C9's only real chance to be guaranteed LANs with the top 10 teams of the world."

Thanks for the fast response! I was thinking that it could be a easy fix but now I wonder why they didn’t just do that. It doesn’t add up now.
"My fiwst expewience of weading was the communist manifesto. It was my vewy fiwst book I was given. It was so good that I witewawwy cannot put it down, cause if I did, I wouwd be sent to the guwag. My famiwy was vewy poow and couwd not affowd even the newest copy of the manifesto. We bawewy had enough to eat so I had to cuwb my hungew by wooking at a pictuwe of Stawin. Evewy time I wook at the pictuwe, I wouwd feew fuww again. I wouwd wead the book evewy night befowe bed to stop my hungew. When I sweep, I wouwd pway the USSW anthem at fuww bwast so Stawin wouwd be pwoud. When I was 5, my famiwy moved to Amewica to buiwd a bettew wife.

When I awwived in Amewica, my fiwst expewience was how happy and fuww evewyone was. In my countwy, my peopwe wewe nevew twuwy fuww. Beef and daiwy miwk was a wuxuwy. Cows wewe mainwy used as a fawm animaw and onwy swaughtewed when theiw wife came to an end.

My ewementawy schoow expewience was twaumatizing. I was constantwy buwwied because I was the new kid in schoow. Duwing wecess, no one wouwd invite me to join in with any of theiw activity. I was excwuded, mocked, and shamed and the onwy fwiend I had was a giww, who watew ditched me to hang out with the coow kids. I wouwd stay in the cownew of the yawd and wead my book. The communist manifesto was the onwy wight in this sea of dawkness. Evewy now and then, some of my buwwies wouwd come ovew and twy to steaw my book fwom me. I was suwwounded and beaten and spat on. I shouted, “I wiww send you to the guwags one day you fiwthy bouwgeoisie!” Wittwe did I know that saying that just got me beaten up even mowe.

Middwe schoow was not any bettew. I was ostwacized fwom aww student activity. When thewe wewe gwoup pwojects, I was awways on my own. I ended up sitting in the back of the cwass weading the manifesto ovew and ovew. Thanks to the manifesto, my weading was faw above those in my cwass. I wouwd get an A on evewy essay and my teachews wouwd encouwage me to intewact with and hewp othews in theiw essays but I decwined.

Whiwe in middwe schoow, I discovewed Quotations fwom Chaiwman Mao Tse-tung. It was vewy fascinating. It became my second favowite book and I was awso not abwe to put it down. I wived my wife fowwowing his wowds.

My high schoow was a wot bettew. I was abwe to find mowe fwiends. I stawted the Communist and Sociawism cwub and was pwesident fow aww 4 yeaws. I was suwpwised that I had a wawge tuwnout fow membews. I did not expect to find so many sociawist and communists among this genewation. The cwub was pwimawy just tawking about how to spwead communism and sociawism. We wouwd spend the fiwst 10 minutes weading fwom the communist manifesto and Quotations fwom Chaiwman Mao Tse-tung. Fow fundwaisews, we wouwd go to the cwubs that awe eawning a wot of money and demand that they pay 70% to us so wedistwibute the weawth among those that did not have a fundwaisew. We awso demanded that the teachews wedistwibute the gwades so evewyone wouwd have the same gwade, a C-. The fiwthy capitawist teachews and cwubs did not agwee to this, howevew. They cwaim that I had no wights to theiw eawnings and that it’s steawing and thievewy. I awgued that the poowew cwubs shouwdn’t have to suffew just because the top 1% of cwubs get to keep aww theiw eawnings. Again, this did not wowk.

Aftew gwaduating high schoow, I got a summew job at Mc. Donawd as a cashiew. I wowked fwom 9 to 5 on the weekends. When I weceived my fiwst paycheck, I noticed that a good chunk of it was missing. I asked my managew and he towd me that it was a tax on my income. My empwoyew expwains that the mowe money I make they mowe money they take at gunpoint. Fwom then on, I was no wongew a communist ow a sociawist since I now undewstand that it’s wwong to fowcibwy take peopwe’s hawd eawned money just to give it to those that didn’t eawn them. I stopped weading communist and sociawist books fwom then on."

I didnt see stats before that. 12-13 they were 4th then 13-14 2nd but then 14-15 back down to 14th and 15-16 at 16th. Kobe got the achilles in 12 so if we look at from 04-12 (this is basically kobes prime although he was great the few years before that too) they avg'd 13.5 which definitely does not make them ""one of the fastest paced teams"". They had 3 years total in kobes prime when they were top 10. In fact 13.5 over that period is basically exactly middle of the pack.

"Thanks! I miss it. On to the question, i assume your lovebirds are bonded to each other? Given that, it can be a bit more difficult to train them into accepting physical contact with humans, but seeing as they are comfortable being held by you, that likely isn’t a big problem. Best advice is start with the beak, and practice a little at a time slowly going back to the head and neck, petting along the direction of the feathers. Also, I know it is difficult, but it is usually best to resist the urge to pet your birds anywhere besides the head, neck, and toes, as they can see it as a sexual advance. Now, again, this isn’t a huge issue if your two birds are mates, but it is something to be mindful of (Internet holds a wonderful variety of sources that tell you what to watch out for in terms of mating signs.) Anyway, this kind of training requires a fair amount of bite tolerance (I have the scars to prove haha), but short sessions regularly usually have good results. Just don’t force it if your birds are cranky. And as always, some birds just don’t like petting, or any variety of other physical interaction, and you can’t train them out of it. But I’d say the vast majority of birds can grow comfortable with it."

"It's between Red and Starless and Bible Black.  Red is the stronger album in terms of front-to-back strong material and production quality.  S&amp;BB does suffer (ever so slightly) from a couple stretches of hushed live-set build-ups (first couple minutes of ""Trio,"" for example, despite the wait being totally worth it), but is the album I revisit the most.

Criston was right, though. He would have to ensure the people of the Westerlands knew him, and knew him well.

""I will go between the two of them."" Jon said. He did not like the idea of Criston alone in Casterly Rock, besides. ""The Rock and King's Landing both. It should not be difficult to fly between them, regardless. If the Reach proves troublesome, I am sure we can speak to the Queen, and reach some compromise.""

Even as he spoke, he wondered. *Desmond Oakheart was dead.* Hopefully she was right. Hopefully Garlan was an understanding man, or... He may have to speak to him directly."

"&gt;I think very highly of Australian women, which is why I applaud Labor for taking their right to free access to abortions seriously.

You think highly of women yet you don't think they are capable enough to make adult decisions like not get pregnant?  

And if they fuck up and get pregnant then they aren't responsible for their actions themselves, government should step in to make sure there are no financial ramifications for their silly decisions?

&gt;I also want abortion to be avilable for women who have life-threatening pregnancies, were raped, or will end up having a stillborn child. 

Fine, allow it for life-threatening pregnancies, rape victims, or if the baby isn't viable or has severe problems.

"IT’S NOT AESTHETIC! 

I don’t want to be fat because:
- I don’t want to go blind from type 2 diabetes (does this discriminate against blind people?) 
- I don’t want to have my legs amputated from type 2 diabetes (does this discriminate against amputees?) 
- I don’t want my liver to fail (does this discriminate against people with organ failure?) 
- I don’t want pain in my joints and skin (does this discriminate against people who experience pain?) 

Aesthetics is the last thing on my mind. I have no problem with how I or other fat people look, in fact I think a bit of chub can be cute. But pain and disease is not pleasant."

"It all comes down to money.

I worked at a non-for-profit aquarium and they suffered and the place looked run down and there were more volunteers than employees because housing marine animals, especially megafauna, is VERY expensive.

SeaWorld has the ability to keep so many cetaceans and other large marine animals because it's a theme park. They get the daily income to feed, house, and care for these animals, as well as pay employees AND do many marine animals rescues.

SeaWorld alone does half the manatee rescues every year and almost all of them get rehabilitated and released. They also help with red tide victims and have the facilities to take in a group of pilot whale calves.

The breeding ban is fantastic and I am very happy they stopped moving the orcas around. With more people pressuring the company to make changes for the animals, the company is listening. They lost a lot of money after Black Fish and changed because people were upset and not coming.

Like zoos, I believe that aquariums can be a place where people can come to be educated and leave caring about the ocean and understand new ideas about it. If we didn't have cetaceans in captivity, and Free Willy, most of us wouldn't care about orcas as much.

Ever heard of a Risso's dolphin, or a false killer whale, or a beaked whale, or the Tucuxi? Chances are no because they are not in movies or common to marine parks. There's over 30 species of dolphin and most people only know about Flipper/Winter or Shamu/Free Willy. 

Would I love to see the orcas in seawater and be in the ocean, omg yes. I would go visit and pay to see them and it would be wonderful. But most people won't pay for that. Most people who go to SeaWorld go to be entertained (The ignorant/incorrect things I've heard guests say there could be a large book) not to go visit the place like a zoo.

Tldr; money and interest keeps sea pens from becoming a thing."

"A few things to consider here:

1) Carys' Hail specifically states that they only count as individual attacks for determining damage location, and dealing damage. 
This means not for determining the 75% freeze chance (which would become a ~99.9% freeze chance if rolled five consecutive times: 1-(0.25^5)) and neither for resolving crits.

2)The spells are supposed to be weak. They are Novice Spells, that cost 3 Stamina each. A Caster with a decent willpower can cast roughly a dozen of these without breaking a sweat. You are basically chucking pebbles or frozen peas at people. Works great on people with shirts. People with brigadines, not so much. Except if you get lucky, and hit a joint, or square in the face (which
would be one crit, not five or even seven to ten crits in one 3 stamina spell).
Even if you only take the bonus damage, you can end up with situations where Cenlly Graig would do 10*10=100 damage that ignores armor at a deadly crit. You would be stupid to cast anything else. It would be the best bang for your buck, or in this case stamina there is.

3) Also remember, you need doctors to heal these at least 7 to 10 crits for Cenlly Graig one after the other. Either from 14 to 18 dc12 checks for those simple crits inflicted in one attack, or 40 dc14 for complex ones, 60 dc16 for difficult ones, or 80 dc18 ones for deadly ones, provided the target is still alive in that last case, after suffering 10 deadly crits in one turn. If so, he will probably look like the the black knight from monty python.

If you want crits to have more ""oompf"", maybe just skip the simple ones. Start at complex ones, lowering the difference required some.

But in the end, its your game. You do what you and your group think is fun and best for you. This is just the math on extreme cases of your proposed rule. Feel free to tweak the rule a bit, like just doing multiple hit on simple crits. There is no wrong way to play.

Tldr: if its simple crits we're talking about, it might seem ok, as you described, but if it's worse crits, and you want to be consistent with the rule, the math goes haywire. 
But you are the dice god. You dont need to care about math. There is both rule zero, and the rule of cool. Have fun."

"You’re*

I’m not seeing many rational points on the pro dueling side. Mostly seeing people talk about how cool televised deathmatches would be. 

Fighting generally isn’t a rational decision. I got in plenty of fights as a kid, but I was of course, a child. I didn’t know much better and was lucky I didn’t fight kids who took things too far. 

OP said duels would only be authorized between two well minded consenting adults. It seems sensible to doubt how well-minded you are if you think it’s reasonable to risk severe injury or death over a disagreement, or even if it’s just for the fuck of it. Even if you aren’t mentally ill, if you are so mad at someone that you are willing to kill them, your hyper emotional state would mean you’re not sound-minded. 

If people crave fighting they should just join a combative sport, where the goal is to demonstrate skill and win points, not to kill the other guy. You could get injured, but the fight will stop if you do at least. 

And finally there’s enough senseless violence in society. This proposal would simply bring more senseless violence."

Title: **14, sold weed to a freind his parents want to press charges.**

Original Post: 

&gt; A few months ago I smoked pot pretty regularly my parents walked in and caught me with one of my friends that same friend continued to smoke pot after we had both had been caught. A few months after I got got I wanted to smoke again (bad idea) so I got in touch with one of my friends and got a dealers name after talking with the dealer a bit we met up and I bought some weed wich i ended up being to scared to smoke. Me being stupid i bragged about it to my friends, the friend i got caught with wanted to buy half of it and I agreed. He went to my house and I sold it to him, just a few days ago he got caught by his parents he told them I sold it to them and they want to press charges against me. I should also add that I had a career in theater and small time acting and I generated a decent amount of money from it.
&gt; 
&gt; I posted this on TIFU but I think I will get more advice here.

""Bronn, if something is the matter it is best to tell me now before I send you off. As to the war?

Ryam wouldn't dream of sending you to fight against the king, especially considering your sister's position...It makes things delicate enough as it is.""

Phone chargers (and phones) having been invented (by me), I am free to rinse and repeat as long as I wish.  Life becomes 2 centuries more advanced in the span of less than 1.  

Of course this would require mountains of work, time, money and effort on my end.  I can only imagine how much research I'd have to do to invent something like a cell phone, especially considering almost none of the components used to make them existed back then.  I'd have to start out with the simpler stuff like food."

"As cliche as it sounds, taking the quick '5 Love Languages' quiz on your phones might help. Did it with my boyfriend just for fun but actually ended up getting good insight on how he feels love in a completely different way than I do. His top language was gifts/physical representations while mine was acts of service. Even though I don't get the same feelings as he does through small gifts, I know if I really want to make him feel extra loved I can communicate to his top love languages. I.e. if I'm having a rough day and he does something around the house or takes care of an errand for me, it makes me feel a whole lot better. If he has a bad day and comes home to a fancy-ish bottle of beer and a candy bar, he feels better.

You'll want to gather as much of these as you can before you build so you dont have slow down your flow of progress.

Next I'd say you'll probably want a list of things to include in your build, like redstone machines, farms, rooms etc. After you have that you can pop into a super flat world and layout a rough floor plan to get an idea of how much space all that stuff will need so you dont end up cramped or with a build of big empty rooms. 

After all that is done all thats left to do is follow the blueprint you layed out for yourself. You'll just have yo focus on looks at that point. Hope this helps :)"

"I don't think she will be happy in Westeros even after she wins the throne. Only way; Sansa dies (or bent the knee willingly) somehow, she and Jon marries and they live and rule together happily after which is very Disney like and won't happen.

That's what i don't like about the story right now and probably ending is George R. Martin's idea. TV Show producers did some mistakes and i don't care much like others really, it's just a TV Show, i'm trying to enjoy. So i'm not talking about TV show mistakes etc. I'm talking about Canon ending, seems like i won't like it and i didn't even care about Dany until this season.

I don't know why i feel like this way. Maybe too much negativity about show affected me. Anyway we will see whats gonna happen."

They are happy living with us because that's what they evolved to do. Why shouldnt animals evolve to have a symbiotic relationship with us? It happens in nature all the time.

I can bet each phase of the 6 phases will be about 3 months apart so at the very least naxx will not be out for over a year from phase 1.

"The definition of a fetus is simply ""an unborn human baby more than 8 weeks old"" so I fail to see what point you make by trying to distinguish between the terms. You make this distinction that the fetus has no rights because it is dependent on the mother for survival, but a baby also depends on parents or whoever is a caregiver for its survival. Are you saying that it's OK for a parent to neglect a 6 month old just because it's dependant on the parents for survival?"

"Atonement has some pretty good Madison/Sundancer.

Amelia has a great Skitterpan romance, though it constantly keeps jumping the line between ""Dawww this relationship is the most heartwarming thing ever"" and ""Holy shit, this relationship is fucking unhealthy."" This is not a criticism, the story is intended that way, but the constant mood whiplashes can be pretty taxing for some readers.

Worm: More Than Meets The Eye also has some great slowburn Skitterpan and is one of the very few fics for that ship to properly develop them as friends before making them fall head over heels for each other.

If you like comedy I can also recommend Boom which is pretty new and actually updated just yesterday. 
In it 21 year old disgustingly cute married couple Goth!Bakuda!Taylor and happy-go-lucky Nilbog!Amelia from Earth Ceti travel back in time and accidentally get displaced onto Earth Bet at the start of Worm and immediately start wrecking canon.

I'd also recommend Nightingale. It's not exactly exceptionally well written, but Taylor/Victoria was such a unique and unexpected couple that I really enjoyed it nonetheless.

"The reason the plot holes and missteps in previous seasons were overlooked (by many) before is because we were looking forward to a great resolution and payoff to the two big story arcs and the complex characters we'd been watching evolve for eight seasons. The writers were present a great setup and had their pieces set for an amazing final season, yet render large chunks of the previous seasons pointless (Bran) and contradict entire series long themes (the petty war for the throne meaningless compared to the threat beyond the Wall). Then they serve us complete bullshit by having a cartoon pirate kill a dragon from miles away on a rocking ship that has to fire over a mountain and somehow can't be spotted by anyone, including Danny in the air, on a clear day at sea, where visibility is perfect for miles.

"Good targets: Code with high number of dependencies; code with a greater level of complexity; code that is dynamic; code that is critical; code that interacts with user input; code with security implications.

General test types: success test (does what it’s meant to); failure tests (behaves as expected when it fails - e.g. error handling); malform tests (handles unexpected/unrelated/edge behaviour). You use packages like Jest or Jasmin for this.  They are very intuitive and simple to use. Integration tests, runs all your tests on all your code at once to see if they still all work when you change a given thing. You would use something like CircleCI (free), Travis or Jenkins. Gold master testing (capturing the result of a process, and then comparing future versions of the code add against runs of the same “gold master” (or known good) version of the process, to discover unexpected changes). You also have simulation testing, where you program an automated tool like Selenium to run through every possible user interaction with your site, and spot changes and errors. Finally you have manual testing, where you develop a test plan and iterate over the application to ensure style, behaviour and outputs are all as desired.

Overall strategy: as a coder you try to make your code fail proof. As a tester you try your very best to break the code you tried to make fail proof. Don’t write your tests as confirmation of your great work. Write your tests as a fiendishly malicious and sneaky devil. Be your own worst enemy, so that no enemy will be that bad or that idiotic. Write your code to succeed. Write your tests to sabotage."

"I rescued a blind cat that was wondering in the middle of the road at night that belonged to an elderly couple.

I didn't realize it was blind, it must have been attracted to the lights. After I saw it I stopped my car on the side of the road and it huddled in the ditch but purred when I get it so I was guessing it was used to humans. I scooped it up and put it in my car and went to Walmart to get some cat food, litter, etc. 

Got it back to my place and it would walk in increasingly larger circles from whichever room I put her in. I just thought that is how she got used to things, but I guess she was mapping the room out. I took her to the vet the next day and paid the $65 for blood tests found out she was blind and had kidney problems (common for older cats). I was in college and poor at the time but they gave me all the different  kinds of meds she would need and I called the animal shelter to let them know I had someone's cat.

I was really upset because I thought someone had gotten tired of paying the $100 a month it cost for the meds of this sick old cat and had left her somewhere. I took care of her for 2 more days but I didn't have the money to keep her, so I took her to the shelter almost sure she would be put down in a couple weeks when no one claimed her.

I got a call 5 days later from an older woman asking if I was ""[My First Name] and had found this cat a few days ago"" I said ""yes"" and she said she was the pets owner and that they lived in the retirement area nearby and their cat had got out one day when they weren't looking. They were real upset because that cat meant the world to them as an older retired couple and being blind and without meds they we're sure the cat was dead. 

The woman asked for my address and how much everything cost and I told I was just happy to help and she didn't need to pay me back or anything because I would want someone to do the same for me.

About a week later I got a letter in the mail with $100 more than the woman figured out the whole thing cost, which meant she sent me $250 and had a nice note written in the card. I'm not the type of person to keep cards I get from holidays or birthdays but 5 years later I still have the card a woman I'll never meet sent me for saving her ��"

It's great that he's feeling better, but healthy people generally think about others and not just themselves.

Fast forward to today, and purpose is hard to come by, and we are men really do not have a great road map on how to get there. 

The copy cat sort of people twist purpose to something vile. Or another example, I just want a flat earth documentary on Netflix, those folks found their purpose in the earth being flat, aka they found their club. 

For me, when I got out of the service I was lost and angry, and I stumbled upon jiujitsu. Once I got myself together, a family, wife and kids, and a job I can tolerate. The family and jiujitsu was enough purpose for me to be a decent human being.

Im sorry, you made a mistake and had an accident and were negligent. Go call a lawyer and plead your case, they wont take it cause they wont be able to win. If the cops were calling they likely gave you a summons or would have  based on vehicle traffic law.

Unlike so many other public figures with long careers or winding arcs, Sanders did not arrive at this moment of national reckoning through a personal or political ""evolution.""

There are easier and more cost effective ways to build personal credit if your goal is solely that. Some credit card companies such as merrickbank or creditonebank offer double credit limit increase if you make payments on time for six months. Which means immediate credit score increase. They have high APR but I’m sure there are more around that has less. I know there are handful of things you can do to achieve good personal credit compared to transferring a business loan to personal.

"Fringe has always been like my top favorite, which (don’t judge) was a lot because of the dynamic between Peter and Olivia and their story. And of course Walter and the absolute batshit pseudoscience that was more pseudo than science (I’m a “mad scientist” of sorts myself). Except the last season was kind of a cop out but the ending was superb like 12M.

But 12 Monkeys stayed true to science, and causality, even though they liked to screw with time more than a lot of shows would. Which was great because it made for great adventures and mystery.

And it got better as time went on  (r/punpatrol, I’m turning myself in). And everything always wrapped up nicely with an ending that was fantastic. I’ll be feeling that one for a while, especially that last scene.

"Trump lost over $1B in a decade. He didn't start with $1B - much of it was borrowed.

He then used that $1B in carryforward losses to offset subsequent income, paying $0 in taxes most years, even when he made millions.

So here's my question: the losses were borrowed money, so did the lender also write off the losses against other income, reducing their tax liability? If Trump borrowed and lost $100M, then the next year made $20M and paid no income tax....is there also another $100M of losses offsetting bank income?

If so, it would seem that Trump committed fraud, and did so at a staggering scale. I'm not a huge fan of taxes, but if I paid them, then he sure as fuck should have paid them."

"Think of their survival practices, such as hunting or den making. Desert creatures may need to find/establish better dens in order to weather the temperature extremes between day and night, and they may need to have better auditory function to hear their prey better. Arctic creatures may be more nomadic since they will undoubtedly have thicker coats or blubber layers (as the other u/ indicated), and can therefore not have to have a “home nest/den”. Even looking at a macro view, you can find differences in their diets themselves, since the ecology of each biome will be radically different. Arctic subspecies may hunt in packs to take down larger prey, whereas desert species may be able to survive on insects. 

Look big and small, and you’ll find some great material."

And the award for sloppiest backpedal in order to save face goes to...

&gt; I never did that.

You are hyperfocused on making sure everyone knows how unacceptable you think the wait times are without so much as a whisper of the other benefits of the system. First you lied to me about my own argument, and then you pulled the ""s-shut up I wasn't replying to you!"" excuse despite the fact that, yes, you were literally replying TO ME, and now you are lying to yourself about the intent of your argument.

&gt; http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Canadian+wait+times

Cute. An lmgtfy link for ""Canadian wait times"". First, the lesser of my two rebuttals is: If you are going to give a snarky response to someone demanding you argue in good faith, you should at least do it in a way that might actually lend them the ideal data. To compare wait times in between countries, you should have googled for me ""healthcare wait times between US and Canada"". **You know, like some sort of COMPARISON**.

But the greater of my two counterpoints is an excerpt from the [second link]((https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/podcast/2018/oct/truth-about-waiting-see-doctor-canada)) provided from your link (emphasis mine):

&gt; SHANOOR SEERVAI: So one of the things that we hear about in the U.S. when our two health systems are compared is that Canada has really long waiting times for health services. How long do people really have to wait to get care?

&gt; CHRISTOPHER HAYES: So I guess it’s — **it depends on what do you think you’re waiting for. So if you are in a hospital and you need surgery you don’t wait. It gets done in — if it needs to be done in 30 minutes it will be done in 30 minutes.** If you need an MRI for care provided in a hospital you will get it whenever — depending on where you are because not every hospital has an MRI, but you will be prioritized and that will happen probably as quickly as it can be done anywhere. **It is as the priority drops or is deemed less by whomever that the wait — so the waits are how long will you wait to see a specialist after seeing your family doctor.**

&gt; **I mean, the one that people will talk about is cataracts, hip surgeries, non — not cancer type surgeries, where there — things will get worse if you don’t get treated. And so you can wait months for those surgeries.**

&gt; SHANOOR SEERVAI: So is there any way that you can speed up your wait times?

&gt; CHRISTOPHER HAYES: Well, not unless you know people. Or if there were cancellations and you were on a cancellation list. Then you could. But there is no, can I buy myself a spot closer to the front? No.

&gt; SHANOOR SEERVAI: **That means that hypothetically, even if I were willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to get a hip replacement, I couldn’t?**

&gt; CHRISTOPHER HAYES: Correct.

&gt; SHANOOR SEERVAI: All right. How do people feel about this?

&gt; CHRISTOPHER HAYES: Well I guess it depends on who you ask, and whether they are in the situation where they do have disposable income that they feel that they should be able to use towards their own, speedier access to health care. Versus the general public belief that this is a right, and if it’s a right then why would we — **why should money trump need? There is really no mechanism to buy a spot in the line. And now that doesn’t mean it’s just first-come, first-served. There are priorities, but those priorities for the most part are clinically based.**

&gt; SHANOOR SEERVAI: Okay, that makes sense. What sort of things are the provincial governments in Canada doing to address this wait time problem?

&gt; CHRISTOPHER HAYES: Yeah, so again they are — so data is a huge one. So let’s provide data on specific times in the wait-time process and compare those across sites. So that you can see where you compare to others. And most people would like to compare favorably. They have put in technological solutions to try and bridge the gap between — we are a big country and a big province, and so sometimes wait times can be travel-limited, or travel-impacted. So we have virtual care through our telemedicine service.

&gt; SHANOOR SEERVAI: Given that wait times are an ongoing challenge, how do people feel about the health system and the taxes they pay?

&gt; CHRISTOPHER HAYES: **Nobody likes taxes, and I wouldn’t say that we are any different than anyone else. So people don’t appreciate paying a large sum of their salary towards that — towards taxes, but they will also say, you don’t touch my health care**, right? So we have just — politicians just don’t go after publicly funded health care, they just — I think they would lose very quickly because **the citizens really believe that this is a major value**. And as much as we don’t want to pay high taxes we love our health care system from its accessibility perspective, even if it is we wait more than our American colleagues do.

From the emphasis I placed on the excerpts, you will learn that:

1. Wait times are determined according to **priority of medical need**, also known as [**Triage**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triage). If someone cannot wait for a surgery, they don't. If someone can, they will wait only as long as is necessary to treat them AFTER high priority patients are addressed.

2. Triage is the **sole determining factor** of your place in line, meaning that people cannot buy their way out of having to respect priority. Your life-saving lung transplantation will ever be delayed because some oil tycoon with tennis elbow booked the OR suite because he's golf buddies with the Dean of Medicine. Canada has an **impartial system**. The only merit you have to a spot in line is how dire your situation is relative to the people around you.

3. Canadian citizens do stew a little about the amount they pay in taxes, but they **appreciate the substantial benefits of their system more**, so much so that it has become hallowed ground upon which politicians do not dare tread. 

Next, let's check out your other link: it's a secondary source by Forbes based on a study by the Fraser Institute that did not compare, but instead simply stated the the amount of wages lost by people waiting to undergo recommended procedures. It made no attempt AT ALL to compare Canada to any other country. Do you know why?

[Because if they did, you'd see that the presence or absence of Universal Healthcare isn't relevant to the problem of wait times](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a049f098dd041552c19372f/t/5b9748362b6a284df4b07e5c/1536641122894/wait+times+-+specialist+5.102.png?format=750w). Canada does have longer wait times than the US, but the # of people waiting a similar amount of time for healthcare in Switzerland as US Citizens is only **0.6% higher**.

Once again, I've demonstrated that **WAIT TIMES EXIST EVERYWHERE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NATURE OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.**

Furthermore, while lost productivity in Canada due to waiting for procedures is certainly tragic, [it isn't an issue unique to Canada](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/average-american-loses-43-during-each-doctor-visit-n440136). US citizens also take time off to see a doctor, and every day they must do this is a days worth of lost wages. The only difference is that in the US, not only can you not go to work, you must also pay *out the ass* for medical attention of any kind. Canadians have the safety net of universal healthcare so that, when they take time off for medical reasons, they are simply ""not making money"" rather than actively losing it.

"To add to the others, I think he was just outmatched tactically.  Very slow to sub when the game was still in reach, reluctant to change things, and again the player shake up.  This was not new to him as was also there last season, just a different level of talent and coaches he is now going against.  Recalled Amaya who is an attacking mid and played him on the wing while putting Saief in the center when Saief has even told the media he is a winger.  A lot of little stuff like that on top of I believe he lost the locker room at least a couple weeks ago.  Could see it in the players and their reactions and visible frustrations.  I feel it was the right decision, but could make things worse in the short term or during a transition.  If they can get a coach before the June break maybe they can build and finish the rest of the season strongly."

"I haven’t seen Star Wars, but I think (based on what I know), Infinity War worked mostly because I - as a viewer - wasn’t *really* promised anything. From the start, we KNEW there were going to be 2 possible outcomes. The good guys win, or they don’t. There wasn’t any deus ex machina, no “plot armor,” nothing. What happened, happened, totally legit and fair, and it didn’t seem shoehorned in."

"This also varies by state and in many cases even by county or city (local authority). So in Chicago it's 10.25 percent, but in some places in rural Illinois it can be as low as 6.25 percent. Some states (like Massachusetts) prevent local authorities from setting their own top-up rates, so there it's five percent throughout the state, just the state rate and nothing else. Four states (I think) don't levy any sales tax at all; Oregon, New Hampshire for sure and I think Delaware have no sales tax and don't allow local authorities to levy one either; Alaska has no state sales tax but lets local authorities levy them up to six percent I think. But just like in the EU, US law now allows states to require vendors to collect tax on their behalf even if mail order--in the end the tax that prevails is the tax where the item is being shipped, not the tax where the seller is located."

"It was such a disappointment.  I always saw him as another one of her victims, but younger sibling's best friend gave me the great insight that my dad is really her accomplice in all of this.  My mom is sick, it doesn't excuse what she did, but she's sick.  My dad could have stopped her at anytime.  Forced her to get help, something, instead he kept dragging all of us back to her abuse so he wouldn't have to take it alone(just like the rocking the boat post).  We were his meat shield.   Although I'm sure he does miss me &amp; my family, more than anything, he wants his meat shields back because it takes the pressure off of him.   A true parent wouldn't sacrifice their kids like that.   I'm not too worried about CPS since we have a terribly underfunded CPS in my state that is drowning under all the kids caught up drug overdose cases.  My mom did call the cops on me &amp; said I was hurting the kids.  Of course the cops came &amp; everyone was fine, and we told them what was going on.  Cops told her she would be in trouble if she did that again.  We broke no contact to get a message to them if they did that again or anything similar, they would never see the kids again.  They are still operating under the assumption that spouse &amp; I will cave and let them back into our lives.  We feel like this will keep them from doing anything desperate."

"NTA. 


Your wife is grieving, however that doesn't expect her from still being the asshole. The way she is going about moving forward is horrible. 




She doesn't want to work, deems your grief as less than hers, and wants to spend money you two do not have. 



The death of a loved one can be tragic, but that doesn't mean the world will stop to accommodate anyone. 





Your wife needs to get herself together and work for the grand funeral she has planned."

"It’s not unnatural to work. It doesn’t matter if people “want” to work or not, they need to contribute to society in some way to provide themselves with basic needs (and of course that excludes those unfortunate enough to be unable to work). Otherwise, who would work?

Are you suggesting everyone should have the opportunity to live as a hunter/gatherer? They worked too, it was just different work. Work has evolved as people evolved, it’s natural. There’s no way around it.

I’ll tell you what’s unnatural though, suicidal ideology. The real problem is the poor work conditions and financial inequality around the world that promotes this kind of thinking. I don’t know how to fix it, but I do know your idea that “suicide’s okay if you don’t wanna work” is not the solution."

 I feed them and  make sure they have a comfortable life, much like fish in an aquarium, (except for walking  them).

They need registered and licensed. Unlike a person, they are rarely required to do anything to maintain their own existence. 

Even wild dogs just have to find scraps to survive, 

No schooling needed, no jobs, no bills, no concern as to where they are or where they are going. 

Sure a baby starts out that way, but eventually they grow up move out (sometimes) and start their own life.

Nothing wrong with premium content. I occasionally buy some stuff here and there. But when the developers start counting on the high paying players to support the game instead of a little bit from everyone in a large and healthy community.....you have a problem."

Now I'm worried about their Star Wars trilogy being shitty.  

 
* Dragons suck now? Those ballistas even hitting a dragon once from that range is completely unbelievable. The worst part is, Drogon will get missed every time from here on out. Really contrived way to make us think the fight is 'evenly matched.' I don't buy it for a second.  
* NK dying kinda ended the series, I just want it to be over now, so I can stop watching.   
* Lots of manufactured drama between people who literally just beat death. That is a bonding moment, not a divisive one. These people who fought the NK would realistically have each other's back forever - but no, they all kinda suck. 
* Arya is gonna get caught somehow and probably killed. She's done. I expect it will be something completely out of character, like her trying to save the Hounds life or avenging the Hound in a rush of anger even though we've been told over and over that she's about as emotional as Bran. It's a mislead so un-subtle, they just have to do it. They won't be able to resist doing the exact, most inexplicable thing. Now, Real Arya would not compromise her mission for anyone.  
* Cersei would have turned Tyrion into a pincushion. No chance he walks away there. 
* Too many problems to go over. This show is kinda boring now. 2 weeks and I'm free.  

Mountain kills the Hound.  
Arya kills the Mountain.  
Cersei/goon captures/kills Arya.  
Jaime kills Cersei. Also dies in the process somehow.    
Jon kills Dany.  
Dany kills Varys.   
Tyrion kills Bronn.  
Not sure on Grey Worm, but if I had to guess, I'd say he gets a castle somewhere, maybe the Twins.  
   
Tyrion, Jon, Sansa survive. Jon becomes Iron Man. Tyrion is the Hand and gets Casterly Rock. Sansa is the northern Lord. Tormund leads the new 7th kingdom of Wildlandia (7th because Dorne vanished awhile ago). Peace for 1000 years."

"What triggers (or forces) a company to do an impairment test on acquisitions?

So if some of their assets were still scaling up, could they not use that to delay any impairment test?   Again, just wondering what actually forces their hand to do one."

"Age, low body fat, toning up at the gym, makeup contouring, hairstyles, and plastic surgery could contribute to women having more masculine features. A lot of those models didn't look so manly in the beginning. Also, VS models' skulls are quite small to be male. Just look up some transgenders for comparison. Also see female body builders with low body fat, and elderly women with low body fat-- they all have textbook masculine facial features, but it doesn't make them male.

What alarms me about some conspiracies is the ignorance of some of its theorists. All women are not born with textbook feminine bodies. Some women are born with a more athletic build (narrow hips, skinny, naturally muscular), while others are more feminine. The skull is definitely something to go by, but I haven't seen an abnormal skull size or density from any of the models. They're mostly just Slavic looking with fake tans, loads of makeup, cosmetic fillers, and weaves for ethnic flair.

Lastly, Megan Fox and Jessica Alba were both being sarcastic when they made those comments. Fox received a compliment and responded with a sarcastic self deprecating remark. If she had said she was God, I guess you would assume that He's back in the flesh... in a dress??? SMH."

"I think facial asymmetry is caused by having an incorrect sense of the center of your tongue (left vs right). If you were to completely numb one half of your tongue, then over time you would start to favor the other, feeling side of the tongue, because its the only side that has feedback. And if this happened long enough, and you didn't try to correct for it, then your sense of where you think the center of your tongue is would should shift towards the feeling side. Eventually the position you rest your tongue in would also shift towards the feeling side, so now your tongue is permanently in the wrong position. Over time this asymmetry will force the other muscles in your face to compensate for the wrong tongue position, pulling them so now you have a noticeable facial asymmetry.

&amp;#x200B;

This is one example of how to get facial asymmetry, and it's the way my face became asymmetric. The solution isn't as simple as ""just mew"" because the natural way you chew is asymmetric and if you just chew in the way that feels comfortable then it will only reinforce the asymmetry. One way to test if this is your issue is to test the flexibility of either side of your neck. But don't simply bend your head side to side, because the entire way you move your body would have shifted for your tongue. Here's what I do to get my neck into the correct position before testing my flexibility:

&amp;#x200B;

Sit in a very comfortable position with your head up. The goal is to do a chin tuck while relaxing your neck and shoulders as much as you can. Most people unconsciously raise up their shoulders during a chin tuck to help the neck raise, but you need to counteract this instinct so your neck can actually stretch into its natural position. You can do this by relaxing the shoulders and letting them feel like a weight that pulls themselves down. So you can think of the back of your neck as a curtain, and its being hung off the back of your skull. You're trying to use the back of your skull to lift up the curtain, but at the same time your shoulders are weights that are hanging down and tied to the curtain, pulling it down and stretching it, relaxing it. The key here is to focus on relaxing the neck and shoulders, letting that whole area lengthen. If you try too hard to pull and force it then you'll engage the other muscles, the ones that asymmetric. It will be easier to relax if you slow your breathing down. Now while keeping the chin tuck the entire time and keeping it as relaxed as you can, try bending your head side to side. One side will feel tighter than the other if your asymmetry is caused by a shifted tongue and neck posture.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is the case, then you need to retrain your tongue and entire body to be correctly centered. I have some exercises I've been using to correct my asymmetry, I can post them if you think you have the same issue."

"A common refrain from folks who have seen governments overthrown, ""your institutions wont save you."" Yes we have checks and balances, and they say trump should be removed by now, but here we are. Behind those checks are people, without people in power who are literally willing to put their lives on the line then checks mean nothing. The constitution is just a piece of paper, its cant protect you. Laws dont protect you, enforcement of laws protects you. Without people willing to stand up this nation can collapse. 

Im not saying we are there yet. Im not saying we need armed insurrection. Im saying Trump is laying the ground work to ignore the will of the people, he has made it clear he believes himself above the law, and he has actively undermined the legitimacy of elections on numerous fronts. I dont expect the democrats to impeach, they will make excuses as to why but they dont matter. Come 2020, if trump loses (and he better) im not sure if he will step down.

"I know I'm late to the party, but I just watched and found this episode to be such absolute trash that it's frustrating to have it's taint on such a great series.  Really the entire Jane character diminishes every single episode though, so it shouldn't be a surprise that 'Jane Patrol' is senseless, pandering garbage from start to finish.

Jane, herself, is a completely irredeemable character that has given nobody any reason to think that she's anything other than a malicious, hostile adversary.  She has demonstrated time and again that she holds her peers in contempt, only wishes to hurt them, and ultimately belongs in a sanitarium. ^just ^not ^an ^evil ^one.  

Furthermore, nothing in this episode was any new information.  The trauma with her and her father has been spelled out so crystal clear before this episode as to render the revelation completely hollow, and her final triumph over his influence at the end came out of absolutely nowhere, demonstrated zero character growth, and was entirely unearned.  

What an absolutely despicable character throughout the entire season so far.  I assume she was better in the books?"

"I don't think Jane would really ever consider moving to Montana. That would be pouring salt into Rafael's wounds, someone she was so in love with that she even had a hard time admitting resurfacing feelings for Michael. Plus, all her family is there. If she truly wanted to be with Michael, he would have to move back to Miami. If he loved her like he says he does, he would, since he would kmow she'd have more to lose by moving to Montana.  

I do want her choice to be very clear without doubt, and maybe even some realization how foolish it was to even go out there to Montana.  I know there is a lot of talk about this being done to show that Rafael is not a second choice. I would love if either in this episode or in subsequent episodes to not make it so much about him not being the 2nd choice, but the right choice for her now. I honestly don't see how Jane second-guessing what she and Rafael had to explore feelings with Michael helps confirm to Rafael that he's not a 2nd choice, anyway. I also don't want Rafael to take her back with open arms, and I'd love for him to get better on his own without her first.  

I have to say that I was  ok with Jane going to Montana despite the horrible timing.  However, from a mom perspective,  can't she at least offer to keep Mateo, or have Petra or even Alba or Xo offer to help out?  Maybe that would be too weird or feel like she was insulting him somehow."

You build up a tolerance to capsaicin, but the scoville rating is probably the most accurate. Best bet is to see what peppers are involved, look up their general average of scoville rating, and compare it to something else you've eaten."

"I like to consider the many generations that have already passed. From plague to the Holocaust, at what point would a creator intervene? I personally don't see a God bothering at all. 

In fact, I believe god is the universe itself. We are a conscious awakening of the universe. A way to observe itself and its vastness. Unfortunately it seems we will destroy our environment to the point we go extinct.

Did the universe intend to create us? I don't think so and I don't think it has any control over us. I just assume we will all return to the universe when we die."

That’s what I like about killer- you can set the tone of the match. I like to be playful and i toy with the last survivor a lot and do stupid shit, it’s a whole lot more fun. If you don’t play killer, I’d recommend doing so especially if you’re getting pissed playing survivor.

"So you're saying minority classes should only be protected when... you happen to be a member of that class? And never otherwise?

Yeah, get out of here.

People can't change their race. They can't change the color of their skin. And they're targeted for it. *Those* people deserve every protection. Just because you're from a smaller state, don't begin to pretend your ""plight"" comes anywhere close to the plight of actual minorities.

You can change your license plate when you move to a new state. It's not an identity that needs protection.

I don't even know where to begin with ""a soft bigotry of lower expectations."" Just another example of the far right co-opting progressive terms to the point of meaninglessness.

As for an example of actual minority disenfranchisement that you so desperately crave: Florida governor Rick Scott personally presided over hearings as to whether people who once served time in prison could regain their voting rights.

"Do you have a firm plan, with precise measurements? If not, you need to do this step first.

Build your dream addition in the computer. Some freeware programs that will work for you is SweetHome 3d, Roomsketcher, HomeDiary, and Sketchup.

Then take your ideas and interview at least three architects. Ask them what it will cost to get permittable plans to give to the City. They should be able to give you their fee schedule (if they charge a percentage of the build) or a flat fixed cost blueprint and elevation price.  Additionally, they ought to be able to guesstimate what such an addition should cost in the greater Seattle area.

Be prepared for some sticker shock.  You live in a part of the country that has gone absolutely nuts over real estate prices.  Materials and labor in your area are some of the highest in the nation.

At this point, with what the architects have told you, you can then decide if you want to move forward on this.  A meeting with your bank, credit union, or mortgage broker to discuss financing would be in order.

Let's say you like what you hear, and the bank is receptive.  It would be time to interview some general contractors. The architects may have suggestions for G.C.s they've worked with in the past and have a good relationship with. It is a competitive industry, so expect a fair spread in the build prices.

You can greatly affect the final cost by having the G.C. build you a weather-tight shell, then you finish the interior as money and time becomes available. You can do things like painting, installing fixtures, and hanging lights/ceiling fans.

You can do this, if you want.  Daunting, but certainly doable."

"This is especially true for Grey. He values his personal convenience over  most everything else, and deflects personal responsibility with the argument that: Any individual's actions make no difference, and any change must be systematic (paraphrased). While this is true that individual action makes negligible or no change, it still does not absolve you of personal and ethical responsibility. Take for instance his position on straws, or coffee cups. He doesn't like paper straws (reasonable), but he also doesn't accept solutions that would even mildly inconvenience him (e.g. metal, wood, or reusable plastic straws). He also refuses to bring a reusable coffee cup because he doesn't want to have to carry it around.

Couple this with reading CARS-level books and articles for fun/research during breaks, Anki in the bathroom/car/waiting in line and whenever I didn't want to get up from a nap during said  breaks, it's not hard to do 8-12 hour days when you can be all study, all the time.

"Nobody wants to replace mana with just time. The complaint people have is the arbitrary nature of mana. You don't get much of an influence at all on where it comes from and that makes the system really boring.

Get stuck with 0 oratory ruler for 40 years? Too bad can't do anything about it. Your mistakes didn't cause this, your success didn't make it better.

The argument that money or time is mana is flawed. You can influence how much money you make through economy, expansion, war treaties, trade etc.  And literally every decision will cost time in some way, time is just there. But Ruler mana is uncontrollable and entirely random. That is what people do not like. The term mana is used to describe it as an arbitray rechargeable magic pool, not something like ""income"" or ""profit"" which would refer to something earned like gold.

I saw a good idea that, with some work, could probably be fleshed out into a way to make the mana system beter. they used eu4 examples as that game has much more to it at the moment. But something like being at full forcelimit contributing to your war mana, drilling doing so as well, wars of conquest etc. You can see how you can influence your mana growth by having a heavy military focus this way, it flows logically, you have some level of control.

They translated this to Dip points by maintaining good relations, alliances, royal marriages, Spreading dynasty etc.

And ADM relating to passing laws, building infrastructure etc.

It'd take a lot to make these ideas work, but I think the example sounds nice, and even if it wouldn't work, looking at it, and understanding why someone would come up with these ideas makes it very easy to understand why people have an issue with random ruler stats governing their game."

And I guess I wasn't clear. In the instance I was talking about the customer drove away pretty fast after the assault. We couldn't even tell them we were calling. 

I appreciate the sentiment. It has occurred to us. We have tried it. But some of these things aren't really crimes. Throwing empty cups at a person isn't a crime. Screaming isn't a crime. And almost none of these things are emergencies. 

Every time someone destroys or steals merchandise, we file a report. And every time a barista has been assaulted, we filed a report. Nothing ever comes of it, but we do. But this thread is not really about ""what do I do when someone is assaulting me?"". We are aware of the options open to us. This thread is about how, with the options available, we are still left high and dry, and when customers see someone misbehaving in a non-dangerous way they should go ahead and step in. We deal with dangerous shit and non-dangerous shit. So when no one stands up for us during the non-dangerous shit, it makes dealing with everything else even harder and even more exhausting."

WE WILL FIGHT ON THEIR BEHALF
"I assume you haven't bleached or otherwise dyed your hair, so it is probably low to normal porosity.  I have very similar hair if the strands are of normal thickness.  In our case, we need lightweight products that can absorb into our hair.  Most hair products sit on top of low porosity hair and need washed off eventually, so co-washing may not be ideal for us.  Rather, we will want a gentle shampoo.  Most gentle shampoos use Cocamidopropyl betaine as an ingredient.  It is coconut-based and found in many baby shampoo.  For conditioners, I strongly recommend using a basic, rinse-out conditioner in between deep conditioning treatments.  [Silk 18](https://www.mapleholistics.com/products/hair-care/conditioner/silk18-conditioner/) is an easily absorbed conditioner you can use as a normal conditioner.

I recommend deep conditioning once a week, at least, for a minimum of two hours.  Longer, if you have the time.  I know of people who sleep with deep conditioners in their hair.  What I do is shampoo as normal, or clarify to remove all oils before applying the deep conditioner.  Then, I section my hair and apply the deep conditioner, mixed with an oil, to each section.  I then bun my hair and put a shower cap on to retain the heat.  Sometimes, I'll put a beanie, or tuque if you're Canadian. over that and leave it for several hours.  I use [Blueberry Bliss Reparative Hair Mask](https://www.curls.biz/Blueberry-Bliss-Reparative-Hair-Mask.html) mixed with [Blueberry Bliss Hair Growth Oil](https://www.curls.biz/Blueberry-Bliss-Hair-Growth-Oil.html).  You can get these from Target or direct from the manufacturer.

A far as stylers are concerned, this is tricky if all you want is a leave-in conditioner.  I only use leave-in conditioner exclusively if I'm refreshing my curls or planning on doing nothing but buns in between wash days.  If I wear my hair down with just a leave-in, it looks great... for a day.  If there is no wind.  If I don't lay my head down on a pillow.  I have long hair and I don't want to wash it and style it all over again frequently, so I aim for doing my hair twice a week.  Because of this, I am heavy handed with all of my stylers and it works out quite well.  I may have to bun it on the last day, but getting four days out of a style is very good.  Downside is it takes a leave-in, curl cream (Moisturizer), and hard hold gel to do it.

I apply my stylers to wet hair and start by placing my part, then I make four sections, one on each side of the part.  I then put my leave-in conditioner in by finger combing it in each section.  I then repeat the process with the curl cream using the exact same technique.  Finally, I use a gel.  The gel takes the longest to apply because I hit each curl clump individually in each section.  I apply it from root to tip by combing it in, followed by pressing my hands together in a praying hands fashion before slinging the finished clump over my shoulder and out of the way.  When I'm done with a section, I cup my hands and gently move them up to my scalp a few times to encourage curling.  I do this for each section of hair before either air drying or diffusing.  Once everything is completely dry, I scrunch the crunch out which, since I am so heavy handed with products, takes a while.  I always have an oil on my hands when I scrunch to keep the frizz down.  You can use the oil I mentioned earlier.

For stylers, I use the [Giovanni Direct Weightless Leave-in Conditioner](https://www.vitacost.com/giovanni-direct-leave-in-conditioner).  You can find the leave-in at many retailers.  If you are going to wear your hair down and only need it to look good for a day, you can stop here.  For the curl cream, I use [Burdock Root Butter Cream](https://www.qhemetbiologics.com/burdock-root-butter-p/brbc.htm).  Use caution with this, it is very moisturizing but has no hold.  If you don't use a gel or diffuse to remove some moisture, your hair may look too oily.  If you're going to bun your hair every day until you wash your hair, you can stop here.  You can get the cream directly from the manufacturer or from Sephora.  If you want a gel to keep frizz and flyaway hairs down, the [Kinky Curly Curling Custard](https://www.sallybeauty.com/gel-styling-products/curl-custard-gel/SBS-801402.html) works quite well.  You will get a very hard hold with the custard, though not as hard as with [Biosilk Rock Hard Gellee](https://www.ulta.com/rock-hard-gellee?productId=xlsImpprod4730087).  You can get the custard at various retailers but I have only been able to find the Gellee at Ulta.  I prefer the custard due to the lighter scent whereas the gellee has a stronger, salon-like, scent."
"Gross.

I shower every day. I don’t wash my hair every day, because it’s color-treated and fragile, and I don’t need to get my hair to the point of breaking off. But, neither my hair nor I smell bad. If my hair is a little greasy, I hit it with dry shampoo at the roots and brush it through, so it doesn’t look greasy or smell bad.

And I shower every day unless I have been so sick I can barely get out of bed, and then I’m damn sure not going anywhere.

I don’t understand people who don’t shower daily. You smell bad. The way to not smell bad is to wash yourself with soap and water, and use deodorant."

"Often times I think B-sides showcase the producers more, and allow for a little more artistry without having to worry about how a song is performed/sounds on the radio.

I think it's always worth listening through the full album at least once.

"Except Inferno is meta because in my opinion there are little to no hard counters to Inferno. Lightning is too expensive to be good against an Inferno user running things like skeletons, ice spirit, and rascals as distraction and defense. Also, you need a push of a decent size for them to even have to use Inferno Tower, so you wouldn't have the elixir to use Lightning anyways. Zap is one of the few counters, and even that only succeeds part of the time. Earthquake only takes out half of the Inferno health with more than half the cost. With a sliver of health, Inferno can take out a Lava Hound, Giant, Golem, or Pekka much faster than any other card except Skeleton Army, which is HARD countered by zap."

Also, Garen's damage doesn't scale with tank items unlike other tanks, so unless you're talking about a bruiser/offtank build with Trinity/Black Cleaver, then he's not full tank and yes he will do a lot of damage. Just remember his ultimate is a single target execute with long cooldown. If you build a bit of health/armor you should never be dying in a full rotation 100-0 unless you're 2 lvs behind."

"OK-- First off, definitely read the FAQ ;-). For perspective on protein in particular, note my flair-- I am a little old lady. And my MINIMUM protein level is 95g a day. I typically get more. If you are worried about excess protein, stop worrying, and read this (but for heaven's sake, don't waste good steak money on more unnecessary stuff!) : 

https://perfectketo.com/how-too-much-protein-is-bad-for-ketosis/

Beyond that, the goal, if you will, of a keto diet for general health and wellness or weight management is fat adaptation, ketosis being the tool that gets you there. As such, blood ketone concentrations don't actually matter-- there are no extant studies I know of that tie blood ketone concentrations to enhanced weight loss, anti-inflammatory benefits or efficiency of fat adaptation. 

If you haven't updated your macros lately, you should do so using an accurate calculator, this one is good : https://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/

And set activity to SEDENTARY unless you bust tail at your job 40+ hours a week. Set protein to .8g if you don't work out, 1g if you do. It really helps to weigh and track your food accurately for a while, humans suck at guesstimating portion sizes :-)."

Just like every article out there on 5G, which mostly talk about 5G and mmWave interchangeably. We agree when you say ""there isn't going to be a huge speed bump."" Note: when I use the word ""hype"", I often don't believe it to be true.

For example, 5G is being hyped as a solution to home internet access issues. That is not true. At 600mhz, 5G will serve a few more people than 4G, a few more per antenna. At mmWave, people can only get internet where they are already close to dense fiber. Most of those houses are already connected.

"Lucan climbed the drab, grey battlements as they slowly mottled a darker hue from the first splashes of morning rain. His stomach groaned with each step, and his laboured legs ached in response. Above him in the gatehouse stood Duncan, quiet and still as he studied the besieging forces. ""You're late,"" he said, without meeting his gaze.

""Forgiveness, Duncan. Didn't much feel like rushing to my death.""

Duncan regarded him coldly. ""This isn't a time for jokes.""

""I wasn't joking.""

Duncan looked back over the battlements. His armour weighed heavy on his shoulders, his face showed as much, though he would never admit it.

""Should take that thing off,"" Lucan said, tapping the battered breastplate. No need to keep up appearances now.""

""I'm not keeping up appearances,"" Duncan bristled, swiping Lucan's hand away. ""The battle will begin soon.""

Lucan turned his back to the besieging forces below, picking at the dirt in his nails. ""Will it now?""

""Yes. Did you prepare your destrier as requested?""

""As requested?""

Duncan studied him closely. ""I didn't say commanded. Though I'm sure you would expect me to.""

""Aye, Sir Duncan, I prepared my horse.""

""I'm a squire, not a knight. Just like you.""

""A knight in all but name,"" Lucan smiled, bowing courteously.

Duncan's hard face betrayed no feelings towards such a notion. ""So you prepared your horse.""

""Aye,"" Lucan grumbled.

""Then you should prepare yourself. Have your armour fitted.""

""Armour? I assumed I was to try and break the lines.""

""And reach who exactly? Our forces are shattered, the remnants lie broken behind these walls, and the King lies sickly and old in the keep."" He turned towards Lucan, ""But you already knew all that, didn't you.""

Lucan stepped forward to meet him. They were boys when the war started, now they were nearly men. ""You calling me craven? Traitor? Think I'll just take off into the night?""

""I think when this is all over, you'll have done nothing to be named a knight.""

""When this is all over we'll be dead, knights and squire alike! Heed your own words! This is our last stronghold, surrounded on all sides. Our garrison is a desperate mix of green boys and crippled men. We're the living embodiment of our King who lies on his deathbed! Fuck a knighthood. Fuck this war. Fuck you.""

""I'll lead the cavalry out on the sun's rise. Straight into the heart of the enemy. If your sentiment changes before then, you are welcome to join us.""

""You ride to death.""

""To honour.""

""To death.""

""Death is coming regardless,"" Duncan declared, his armour suddenly resting easy on his shoulders. ""Better to meet it of your own accord.""

""How the roles have changed,"" Lucan sneered. ""It's not hopeless. We can live yet. There's enough horses for the able bodied men to make an escape in the night.""

""By the Gods, have you no honour? Truly, you are a coward.""

Lucan stepped closer, his voice a whisper. ""Careful, Duncan. I'll make no apologies for wanting to live.""

""Then go live. I'd rather die fighting for my King, than live knowing I failed him.""

Lucan laughed. ""Duncan the dutiful. And what of the others? Are they all as eager to die as you?""

""They will fight -""

""Harry, Mark! Up here!"" Lucan bellowed down to the men by the drawbridge. ""Settle a bet.""

They waited in silence as the men approached. ""What?"" Mark spat.

""Duncan says the men are to charge the heart of the enemy on the sun's rise, you two included.""

""And?"" Harry asked, resting on his shield.

""And I said you wouldn't.""

""On what account?"" Harry asked.

""This one,"" said Mark, driving his spear upwards into Harry's throat. Duncan flew forward, smashing his gauntlet into the attacker's face. It cracked as Mark's nose shattered. Duncan unsheathed his bastard sword, lifted it high, and dropped it to his side as Lucan's dirk pierced his nape. His eye's screamed where his mouth could not, and his hands scrambled desperately to reach Lucan. He fell to his knee's with a thud as Mark crawled to his feet, wrenching the spear from Harry's throat. He aimed it at Duncan and made to thrust, but was halted by Lucan.

""No, let him fight,"" he said, rounding the squire slowly. Duncan's arms fell limp, his eyes blinking but empty, mouth moving yet silent. ""Fight, Duncan! That's what you wanted! Fight! Fight for your King! Duncan the damned. Duncan the desperate."" The squire fell back in a heap, pushing the dirk deeper through his neck. Lucan stood above him. ""Duncan the dead.""

He turned to Mark, still nursing the remains of his nose. ""Place him in the trebuchet. Fire him into the enemy.""

""Subtle,"" Mark mumbled.

""Necessary,"" Lucan replied. ""This war is lost. I won't be lost with it."""
"Yup, my thoughts exactly. It makes me wonder if this guy had found targets that he actually was looking for. Terrifying thought."

"I have, still have my Atari ST and Notator 3.2 it's MIDI handling is still better than anything else out there today. Can't explain why it just seems tighter and sounds better - especially in doing drum loops and sequences.

It can't do audio or internal sampling, nor soft synth plug-ins so it doesn't get as much use anymore, but sometimes I like to fire it up and just mess around, brings back so many great memories of the 80's and early 90's music I was working with."

He was a prize ar\*\*e and was seeing someone else within days.  He phoned me to say he'd left sunglasses at my house  and really needed them back. So said ok - will see you at X time- at this location with them.

I spent a couple of hours with pliers and a small hammer - tinier and tinier metal frame segments, smaller glass fragments until I was satisfied couldnt do any worse. Am kind of cringeing just thinking about it.

End of story, put the glass gravel and dust, along with metal tiny bits into an envelope, sealed it well, went to give the Ar\*\*e his stupid fancy mirrored expensive sunglasses back.

I went in and 1st thing I heard was Dave,  him shouting ""Hey Greg - got your glasses back for you now, thanks for the loan, sorry I misplaced them last week - did your mum go mad?"".

I threw the envolope at him and ran away. I liked Greg.

Was kind of satisfying at the time."

Previously he would bark at excited kid's noises or those who ran past. Never lunged, always backed up. 
I would take him for walks everyday past the local elementary school at recess. Started on the far side of the road + eventually got closer. Lots of treats.
He no longer barks when the neighbours kid is excited + yelling, and will just grumble when out in the world or w/ kids at home. 
When we have friends w/ young moving kids visit he is muzzled + they are told that he wants to play but doesn't know how yet, so they have to teach him gentle playing (which means no running games).
A very close friend of ours had a baby recently (7mo now) and they come to visit frequently. No problems so far + the dog has been off leash and unmuzzled."

"To start with, kids like us who fall under the label “Aspergers”, tend to be more intelligent than a neurotypical. I’m not just saying that to brag. To start, our corpus callosum is slightly larger than the average persons, thus making our brains strongly connected. Our frontal cortex is more in tune, thus making us better problem solvers. That’s partially where the Aspergers stereotype comes from. We do, however, have a lot of difficulty comprehending social situations which is the downfall of us all. Aspergers can produce some of the most brilliant minds, but they can’t be put to use because of their social ineptness. I’m far from having a brilliant mind, however I consider myself of above average intelligence. I can’t say for certain how everything works in terms of Aspergers since it is a developmental disorder, however I can say it helps us significantly. Intellectually that is. Most of us are socially inept. I can’t hold a conversation for shit."

The squandered chance by Bonsu and Son springs to mind. Plenty of time in the box unable to actually get the shot off.

Plus golf has an extremely high level of honor, integrity, and gamesmanship woven into its history and culture. Random people watching on TV or in the crowd used to be able to call rule violations on professional golfers because integrity of the game, though they recently stopped taking TV rule violatiom calls.

"The Empire's tech tree is very weak compared to nearly all game 2 factions.  Just look at the High Elf and Dark Elf tech trees.  They have more techs to research, with greater bonuses.

The Empire's one mechanic is nearly non-existent.  The fact that you can ignore Offices, and it wouldn't change your campaign at all is disturbing.  Empire Offices provide weaker bonuses then both the WE and Vampirate Offices mechanic.  Furthermore, the Empire has more LL/LH candidates then any other faction, yet they have 3 LLs.  As the flagship faction for the entire setting, and arguably one of if not the most important faction, it's pretty sad the state the Empire is in currently.

The Empire's roster is fine.  It's their campaign mechanics, only 3x LLs, and lack of additional start locations that diminish their gameplay!"

"The Grandmaester would have been met with a pair of guards at the entrance to the Tower of the Hand, the men allowing Gawaine entry. One of the two would lead the Grandmaester in further, up the spiral staircase, and to the audience chamber of the tower. Another pie of guards would be present there, admitting the men entrance, where Bennifer would be waiting at the far end of the room, seated in his chair.

“Grandmaester, yes.” Bennifer nodded as the bookworm came closer, “There’s a matter which I require you for. One that must be completed with urgency,” he spoke, before gesturing to a servant to the side of the chamber, her handing the Maester a scrolled piece of parchment.

It read: 

&gt;To the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms,

&gt;You are hereby invited to the coronation of King Matarys of House Targaryen, First of His Name. The event will take place in the Red Keep at King's Landing, on the 6th month of the year 226 AC. Grounds will be prepared for the tents of those in attendance, and a feast held within the quarters of the Red Keep, food and wine being provided. However, it is requested you bring no more than a personal guard of twenty men.

&gt;The heads of all Great Houses in Westeros must attend this event, in order to swear fealty to their new King before the Iron Throne. 

&gt;His Grace, King Matarys I Targaryen eagerly awaits all those who shall attend the event.

&gt;Sincerely, in the name of King Matarys I Targaryen,

&gt;*Lord Bennifer Blackwood, Hand of the King*

“Copies will need to be made,” Bennifer continued as the man read, “One for each Great House. Also add an additional note to the invitation, informing the Lords to distribute the letter to their vassals.” He explained with a shrug. As many people as possible should witness the coronation. “I trust this will be no trouble?”"

There are new skills available, but they have carefully avoided some specific ones for good reason. But for new skills, Mystic boost, link skills (on Myrhh that can actually rock, score +6 def plus another stat just for positioning, amazing for her), chills, and plenty more - but like with a lot of games, one or two skills are usually optimal, and let's be brutally honest here, if you haven't replaced QR on her for anything I've mentioned, that means they would have to release something horrifying broken to make QR budge from that spot. And that's why everything seems so underwhelming, because QR is crazy good."

Wish I had more courage to jump on more complex and challenging tasks. Instead I played safe and only picked up tickets that were straightforward and I knew I'd be able to accomplish within the given estimate. Anything that I wasn't familiar with I would pass on and let others take care of. As a result I sort of pigeonholed myself into easier problems. And my bosses noticed that and essentially wouldn't trust me with more complex problems. Even years later when I was ready to tackle them.

"(First timer) 

Maybe I shouldn't be surprised in the tonal shift in this series because it's something that happens a lot in anime (the first episode usually has some sort of hook that gets discarded later in the series, in this case: fanservice wolf girl). I was expecting more slice-of-life character-based narrative, but the memes were true: it really looks like the series is turning into a treatise in economics. I like it when an author has a passion for something outside of the medium (like how Yuru Camp exposes that passion for camping, or like how Non Non Biyori paints a nice picture of the joys of living in the countryside), so it's nice to find out that this series is more than just fanservice and genre tropes.

The character development is also coming along pretty well. We get to see Lawrence in his element; less of a bashful young man and more of a wheeler-and-dealer. Holo also gets to show off her hundreds of years of experience and preternatural abilities. I feel like that's sort of secondary though to this monetary mystery that seems to have taken over the plot and grabbed my interest."
"It's actually a decent game during the leveling stages. Even about 20 hours into endgame it's still somewhat fun. The issues that you read about (good loot scarcity, broken crafting, inconsistent stats, lack of content, etc) are most noticeable in the endgame and for many of us, they are all we can even see anymore. Add in the various bugs (I've been lucky in that regard, at least) and intentional (but poorly implemented) systems and it's just to much for people.

All that aside, I hope you have fun. I did. Just don't expect it to last forever unless your only real interest in the flying."

"Worst experience: a guy sits on the toilet and immediately starts shitting obnoxiously loud and keeps saying “I hate using public bathrooms” to himself. After the fifth time he said it I glanced over and noticed two sets of feet in the stall. His work boots, and a small pair of pink crocs. Facing him. Not facing away. This dude was taking a shit and his daughter was watching. I was baffled.

Weirdest was in high school. I finished up doing a poo and realized there was no toilet paper. No one else in the bathroom I’m having an oh fuck moment. I have extreme anxiety and the bathroom is something that escalates that. I finally get the courage to pull my pants up and try to run to the next stall. No toilet paper in there, and it’s also full of shit. Fuck. I’ll run to the next one. Same thing. Only one stall left. I’m running out just as another guy who I kind of know walks in and he sees me leave one stall and going into the last. Full of shit. No toilet paper. Fuck. Now this guy is b lining right to me. He enters the last stall with me an looks into the toilet and sees it’s full of shit and he says “what the fuck are you doing haha..”

I blurted out “oh haha.. they’re all full of shit haha..” just as another guy walked in and saw us both peering, so he also b lines right over and peers in. Now three of us are just looking at this shit that isn’t even mine. Another guy walks in, same god damn thing happens. Suddenly there’s five of us just looking at this poo. I slinked away and ran to a different bathroom to wipe my ass."

She would always punish me for this, putting me in the corner, hitting me, dumping a whole tote full of toys and making me pick it up, and one time she even called her friend who was a police officer. This went on for about 3 years until it finally stopped. My mom found out a few years later that her cat was actually chewing her whiskers off. And even then, she didn't apologize, she still insisted that I did it. Even when I was gone it happened! (She's not so bright lmao)"

"Yeah, I basically think it is mental fatigue. I get that easily too. The walk is good for you. Sometimes I lay down in a more upright position as to not get too comfortable, and rest my eyes for 20 minutes. When my ADHD mom said she did this, I thought she was crazy. How can 20 minutes help? And rest during the day? Can't do that. But just closing my eyes and listening to music or the tv so I don't listen to my brain talking helps a bunch.

I also like complete silence like someone else said. Noise cancelling earbuds have been a game changer for me. I didn't realize they worked pretty good without having to listen to music. But they were expensive. I hate spending money on things, esp. something that seems frivolous, but now I see why it's necessary for me, not frivolous.

"Any advice for a sleep-trained kiddo in a toddler bed waking up in the middle of the night?

My almost 2.5yo is in a toddler bed and is very nearly trained to stay in his bed at bedtime (it was a slow crawl to this point!) but he has started waking up in the middle of the night again. He’ll immediately run to the door (we have a baby gate in the doorway) and cry for us. We have resorted to patting his back until he falls back asleep or else falling asleep on the floor in his room in order to get him back to sleep.

We are hesitant to let him CIO because baby brother sleeps in the room next to his. And also because when he is screaming, no one is sleeping.

Just curious if other parents have had a similar experience with their 2.5yo and what you might suggest?

Thanks in advance!"

"To be clear, I never expressed a desire to say it in any setting, hatefully or socially. I don't care to use racial slurs of any type.

I simply made the point that it's ridiculous for black people to constantly racially berate white people with horribly offensive racial slurs, but get mad when white people do it back.

In short, my entire argument can be summed up like this: What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

All this origin of the word was a bit on the unnecessary side of things."

I've got a couple friends that play it and they all say it's pretty great. I'm currently playing through DMC 4 and I'm on mission 13. My only complaint is the stupid ass camera angle in DMC 4. Like what? You expect to to kill demons while staring at Nero's ass? Anyways the camera seems better in the demos and the game looks really cool. My main question is: does DMC 5 have enough content to keep me playing for a long time? And if not, how long would I have to wait for a special edition to release?"

"The interview itself perpetuates myths about serial killers. I might get some hate for this, but this is very skewed to American male SKs, and seems to do nothing about clearing up the myths.

What I find most interesting about SKs is that once you ignore the top 30 American Serial Killers (by ""top"" I mean most publicized or mythologized), you realize how wild the world really is. For example, poisoning is a very popular method for serial killing.

We have so belittled that method of killing, there is a comedy movie called Arsenic and Old Lace about 3 serial killers, two of whom are ""harmless"" old ladies who get away with it even though the protagonist knows.   


But the UK had to pass the The Arsenic Act in1851 because it was being bought too often for murder (mostly by women).

South American SKs have huge kill numbers. Garavito is at 138, and López is at 110.

I don't think those compare at all to medical SKs like Harold Shipman (suspected of about 250 kills), or even American doctor Kermit Gosnell's estimated 90.

That's where the real myth busting comes from: learning about what's actually happened and is happening in the world."

"As a new walker myself, I’ve been lucky to have had very good initial two walks. No funny business at all, sweet people and excited but controllable dogs. 

And what I would recommend is once you’ve been accepted as a walker and have the correct walker app, there is a filter option to find the walks you want in the locations and time period you desire. If you are worried about not picking up enough business (the largest distance it will automatically search for from your current location is 10 mi), then you can add in a bunch of different locations to search around. 

So for me, I first check my current location, then my work location (which is w/in ten miles but still covers a slightly different area), then my S/O’s apt area, and then my school address (closest to farthest). The school/SO apt are both more in downtown areas so they might get a bit more activity than my house which is far west suburbs. And even if I’m not there, I might pick up a walk because I can drive over there within 50 min. Also if you start looking at what areas are more active at certain times of day, you might decide that you want to drive to a certain busy location at hustle time just to get a few walks :)"

"My brother said this,

"USB Power Delivery. It's an open fast charging standard. MacBooks, Chromebooks, some Windows PCs, Nintendo Switch, many other smartphones, etc all use it. Most anything with USB-C charging that isn't a phone, or a phone that doesn't use Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0 is USB-PD. 

The difference is that with USB-PD both ends of the cable have USB-C connectors, or the cable is permanently attached to the charger. It will never have the big USB-A connector like the Moto cable and charger do."
/r/tributeme is a place...
Contact your card issuer and dispute the charge is your best bet.

"Personally I feel bro is a little more gendered than dude or guys, but I don't see any issue with it. The use of ""guys"" in particular as a gender neutral term to refer to a larger, especially mixed, group is pretty common and fairly widely accepted. Even ""dude"" is somewhat common, but less so.

I love language. I have a pair of useless degrees (Communication and English) that together are perfect in studying the shifting power and meaning of words."
"Consider this though: did she have other children with her? Possibly smaller children? And they're possibly in a stroller? And she's by herself, trying to catch the train that's coming any minute, and the little boy insisted he suddenly had to pee right now, and wouldn't make it back down the steps or ramp with mom trying to get a stroller down too, then possibly waiting in line for the bathroom, just to have him pee himself anyway and now she misses the train, waits with a pee-soaked kid who is probably not entirely happy with now being pee-soaked since there's no diaper to pull it away from his skin, and everyone else complaining about the ""trashy woman's kid"" that smells like pee? 
Or even if it's just her and the little boy, he probably didn't say anything about having to pee until he suddenly had to go very badly, and finding/getting to the bathroom or waiting to use the bathroom on the train would have been impossible, and again lead to pee-soaked child and complainers. 

Give the poor fucking mom a break, guys."
I was a retail manager for years and we had rings of “pros” who would come through and kill it.  Even with the gift card malls in high traffic areas it seemed like we would regularly get communication to dump loads of them in the trash or check the backs.  At one point they were replacing the scratch off with a sticker that looked similar.

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Season 5 wasn’t bad at all (yeah I said it, Dorne wasn’t bad) just very unremarkable and I can’t really remember a lot of what happened, 6 was again not great but the last 2 episodes were fantastic, then 7 and 8 are genuinely bad. The actual writing has gone off a cliff. I don’t just mean plot wise, but the dialogue is awful too. Main reason I liked e3, as it had hardly any dialogue."

"It's very difficult to get a job in the field unless you are in the top 10% of graduates/students, imo, so make sure you study hard and take every work or internship opportunity that you get. You'll most likely have to get to Masters/phD level for the type of analyst job that most people envisage, so prepare yourself for a potentially long academic career. (I'm on this 'pathway' myself, actually) 

Also, take every GIS paper possible. It's a digital spatial analysis tool that is essential for pretty much any and every job in a geographical field.

 Most of human geography is inter-disciplinary, so try really hard to broaden your horizons. There'll be a lot of subjects that you might not have encountered before at a high school level, such as law, politics, psychology and philosophy. Geography and geopolitics pulls and weaves from other social sciences, so don't restrict yourself to a narrow band of what you think human geography is. Also, prepare to be really frustrated by the many dumb political opinions that people may have :P"

"You dont need a ""fair"" reason to break up with someone. Seems like you're missing the companionship part of a relationship. I would just tell him what you said here. You guys will either talk it out or you can find someone with a work schedule more like yours. 

Relationships are hard. Fucking. Work. And you will go through some shit lemme tell you. When my husband and I were still dating and got our first apartment I had a really shitty job and he was working for our pos landlord for rent and extra money. We were broker than broke and had no food (I mean literally at the end of one month we had taco shells, a bag of sugar, coffee, half a can of peanut butter and that was our entire kitchen), he was a diabetic with no insulin either, and we were both starving with the low fuel light on. Obviously we both felt like dirt all the time and were constantly stressed out. It was rough but now we both have good incomes and we're married and happy with the little family we're building. 

Ask yourself, is this the man you want to be with forever? Are you willing to stick through the hard times for the ultimate outcome? That's the ultimate question cause you'll go through rough times with everybody and it seems like you're ready to flee this one but just make sure about it before you regret everything. Theres no way to not hurt him but I guess just tell him everything you said in this post cause theres no easy way to explain all of that to somebody and theres no way not to hurt him. Chances are he's missing the companionship as well.

Also I'm with the fact that he needs to pay off his debts and start looking elsewhere. I've had management like that before and I will never go back there."

"More than likely you are hearing the ANC (active noise canceller). It's always running even with audio off. It's attempting to cancel out engine noise. It uses microphones in the cabin and a module hidden under the dash. Often it breaks down due to a microphone being out of tune (the system is calibrated to each microphone) but can fail due to other reasons.

You can/must disconnect the ANC (pull the connector) from the audio unit itself to stop it.

"Yes and no... Content of rooms are more flammable ( petroleum-based everything from carpets to couch cushions to curtains)  than they used to be.  But there are a lot of modern construction materials that are actually quite a bit safer.  For instance using fiberglass for insulation as opposed to cellulose fill, sheetrock and fire caulking are lifesavers, fire-rated doors and not using a balloon construction (or placing fireblocks between studs) can do an impressive job of containing a fire inside a room as opposed to letting it spread along the ceiling or through gaps in the walls.  Not to mention all the improvement in the electrical codes ( better Breakers, fewer differential metals, many more grounded outlets.)

Of course, none of the sheetrock or fire doors are in when a place is under construction so during that time frame: Yes, they are flammable death traps.

"We know it has an effect - this much has been established by the literature. And, if it was not clinically significant effect, people wouldn't be using it as a cancer adjunct.

The effect is likely to be over the longer term, since it involves upregulation, rather than direct signal inhibition (ie - COX2, etc),  in the manner of other oral nutraceuticals and medication, such as curcumin. 

Determining the dosages and durations likely to have an effect is pretty straightforward: there's no reason to expect them to be any different than ones the cancer studies found."

"&gt;Why does Blizzard think this is acceptable?

It's not like they have a choice. They can't just snap their fingers and make 3-3 go away. Current balance changes shows that blizz is doing all that they can to weaken 3-3 without killing heroes or doing drastic measures (i.e. brig to kill dive). Also no one can really be sure how tweaks could affect the pros. Like you could only see how owl meta is affected by changes during a stage and stages are played on 1 patch. And pros tend to play what is optimal for them not what is optimal in the game (i.e. hanzo usage in s1 stage 4 skyrocketed because pros were practicing him in prep for the patch so despite not playing on the hanzo 2.0 patch, they still played hanzo). So imagine practicing 3-3 for a very long time and thriving in it like most playoff teams, of course they would stick to it because thats what they are best at even though its not as strong as it was anymore."

"I had this idea, before I knew how far gone the NRA was, about how they could be the stewards of a gun registry.  I know one of the reasons a registry isn't popular with the 2A types is that they're worried it just makes a ""come and get it"" list.  But if the NRA were to hold the list they could be sure that any warrant for information was legit.  

Same kinda goes for the NRA being like an armory.  You store all your guns except for one for home protection at the armory.  You go hunting or whatever, you go check it out from the armory.  The armory would be liable for anything that happens with the weapons in their care.  Sure, this doesn't do anything for the ""bad guys"", but I think it would really help with a lot of the other gun violence we see.

But this was all predicated on the idea that the NRA was a trustworthy organization.  I still like the ideas, but not with the NRA."

"I returned to my little home town a couple years after leaving the military while trying to figure out what I was gonna do with the rest of my life. I was kinda down on my luck so instead of buying cigarettes I was buying cheap loose tobacco and rolling my own.

One day I'm sitting on a bench at the park, enjoying the weather and rolling a cigarette when not one but THREE police cars roll up and literally slide sideways to a stop right in front of me. The officers all jump out of their cars and approach with their sidearms drawn, ordering me to lie facedown on the ground while they empty my pockets and backpack and dump my precious packet of Top all over the ground.

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***The following is a copy of the above post. This comment is a record of the above post as it was originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

So here's the backstory:

About a year ago my good friend was homeless due to shitty situations. Because of this, I offered to have him stay at my place. He's a really great person and overall we get along well. 

Recently he lost his job due to breaking some rules but was quickly rehired somewhere else. In the time between jobs, he was tight on money. My family and I that live in this house with him have been very helpful in providing food and lending him some money here and there.  

So now to the problem

We recycle and we like to let our recyclables accumulate and then take them to a recycling center. We use the money we get from the recyclables to fund household items that we all use like laundry detergent. Today I went to check how much we had accumulated and if it was time for a trip. I went out to the backyard where we usually keep the bags and to my surprise, all the bags were gone. (At this point there should have been about 9 bags)

There was only one logical reason all of these bags would be gone and that was that my friend had taken them to the recycling center. 

I confronted him about the bags and he admitted that he had in fact taken the bags and recycled them because he was tight on money and needed it for gas. He did not ask any of us if this was okay or even text us about it. 

It's not really about the money but about the fact that he just presumed that it was okay to take them and pocketed the money for them. He also would have never brought it to light if I didn't say anything. 

AITA for being mad at him for just taking the bags? Or should I just let it go? I can't help but feel a little taken advantage of.

"So right after we got married the crazy fights started.  She destroyed me, and then said I'm crazy and I need to get help.  I called a therapist and scheduled an appointment, I started going, but didn't tell her because i was embarrassed.  When she found the card in my wallet, she went nuts.  She accused me of telling strangers things and that I'm pos for not telling her.  In retrospect, if I found the card in her wallet, I would have given her support and told her I'm happy she's going and I'm here for her.  Nonetheless,  3 years of my life have passed and I felt sick all the time, gained weight and white hair so fast .  This last fight I had it with her and left, i was away for 6 days before i was hoovered back in.  But in those 6 days, I slept better, my stomach stopped churning and I actually lost weight.  I know what I have to do and I think you do as well, when your gut is telling you to run. You need to listen."

"I hardly see any well-grounded correlation. Also ""hero"" is really a relative term depending on whose point of view is being taken.

A character that starts off fighting no-questions-asked in the name of a ruling organization, who at some point has doubts or even outright denounces their allegiance to said organization on moral grounds is **a popular basis for characters who go through character development**, namely an exploration of how a character's perception has changed compared to when they were first introduced chronologically. Just off the top of my head, some characters include:

* Cecil Harvey (Final Fantasy IV)
* Jack Bauer (24)
* CT-7567 Captain Rex (Star Wars The Clone Wars)
* Emma Sheen (Z Gundam)
* Just about every character in pre-11 Fire Emblem who starts off on a different side that can be recruited"

"When he can talk about his actions with remorse and understanding. 

I’ve participated in restorative justice programs with domestic abusers who are in jail. I’ve sat in on hours of their counseling and have seen abusers accept what they did and I’ve heard them use their words (not quotes from the curriculum) to explain how they hurt people, what was going through their minds during their violent moments and I’ve heard them discuss how they understand the impression people have of them now that they are known violent abusers. 

I don’t expect him to film or record his learning sessions and share, there’s absolutely no reason those should be public. 

I will forgive him when he shows he’s learned. It’s extremely clear when he victimized himself in the boos that he hasn’t learned. Of all the people I’ve seen grow through domestic abuse, not a single person has grown to continue to find themselves the victim. 

Once you realize your inability to control your emotions has caused physical harm to those you love, you stop claiming to be the victim. You gain empathy for those you abused and you place that empathy above your victimhood."

"Intellectualizing means you detach/dissociate from your emotions. Say you have a lot of anxiety before giving a big speech for example. Intellectualizing is just going ""having anxiety before giving a speech is to be expected, but there is no reason for it so I'll just ignore it"". Some degree of that is helpful, but too much of it and you're basically invalidating your own feelings. You ignore the feeling but it doesn't go away (think of your anxiety like a scared child being told ""don't be so sensitive, you have no reason to feel that way when everything is totally fine"" - they don't feel comforted, if anything they're more upset now). 

Processing the anxiety however means you recognize its place in your mind and in your body, you don't detach from it, and you think through it but also emotionally self-soothe and remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with feeling that way."

Whether you like NIN or not you can't really deny the fact that Reznor's influence on other music is pretty significant and his music was very unique and fairly experimental when it came out. Not a huge fan either but I certainly wouldn't say NIN sucks and can't be compared to Drath Grips.

"I don't know why some of the comment is somehow also normalizing this stuff. Some are giving funfacts and jokes which is super okay.

Poligami adalah bentuk kekerasan dalam rumah tangga. Soekarno istrinya berapa? Sembilan, saudara-saudara. Memang, 7 diantaranya sudah diceraikan. Still, That fact makes me super angry. Terlepas dari manapun istrinya, kebangsaannya apapun, whatever. I don't like it.

Yang bilang maksimal empat, yes. Al Qur'an states it. Tapi jangan diabaikan prasyarat dan ayat selanjutnya, harus bisa adil. Dan seberapa keras kita berusaha untuk adil, kita takkan mampu.

Poligami itu kekerasan. Bentuk ketidakadilan. Harus dilawan. 

""he did so many oopsies in the past.""

Aren't we all? 

Yes, that polygamy and some other issues makes me angry. Tapi Soekarno juga punya kelebihan lain. Apa yang dilakukannya (tak semua) membuat Ia layak disebut pahlawan. And so, I still admire him. But he's not God or Lord. He has flaws. And I can still admire him."

"Sorry for being an Essay Andy, but if you want to real talk for a moment, let's real talk for a moment:

Why let this put you in a bad mental state? I am not trying to shame you for being sad about something, but I guess I don't quite understand. You might not want to read this if you're not in a good mental state over it, actually, but I'm trying to understand/level with you -

This is happening because people are actually really, really bothered that someone they look up to is showing himself to be a super petty asshole right now. He is literally going out of his way now to DM people and even reply to people on Reddit with major spoilers just to ruin their enjoyment of something. I haven't circlejerked at all in /r/destiny, but people like myself are fucking annoyed because we look up to Destiny and right now he is acting super petty and immature over this entire thing. It's going to come back and bite him in the ass hard one day, and it makes him look pretty bad as a left-wing content creator/debater to boot.

All people wanted was for him to acknowledge that he didn't handle it right, or apologize, or just in the future do something as simple as say ""spoiler warning"" first. But instead, he tripled down and started DMing spoilers to people just to be an asshole, and he seemed fucking *proud* of that.

Sorry. I've been a Destiny fan for a while, and I probably wouldn't have found Hasan without him, but he is being extremely unreasonable and immature right now, and it is really not a good look. *And he keeps digging himself deeper because his ego is so fucking huge*.

By the way, I got downvoted to oblivion yesterday too, in Destiny's subreddit, for saying that I was tired of the circlejerk. But you know what, fuck it. He needs to grow up. So again, I'm sorry if this is actually really bothering you, but none of this would be happening if Destiny wasn't being such a childish ass about this."

"She is not, and I know it only problem is human nature. We love toxic shit. 

She is not bad, just not good enough(or atleast with me) she has a stupid merry go lucky attidue and I am a walking aura of blackness and sorrow consuming everyone around me and another that touches me I absorb the light in their eyes and the hope in their pathetic soul as they attempt to scream but discover that existence is a lie and that something or someone is controlling them and their thoughts and they are nothing but mere puppets in a stupid game that they dont want to play.

She just doesn’t act right or normally like how you would act to someone tell you they will kill themselves and leave you a letter, I look at this and say what if she said that to me, oh my god I think I might hug her for the rest of her life not to do that, and I didnt get a response even which means I am not worth her time.

She cant find someone else to talk to I guess so she keeps coming back, and same with me.

If I find someone better That shows actual love and affection like any normal human will(not necessarily partner just really good friends would be really good) I honestly dont think I would give 2 fucks about what happened, cuz I tried my best and kept my cool, dealt with shit professionally, was forgiving and didnt look back, saw forward and she didnt realize that.

I can say that I have wasted my time, but I did learn, I gave my time to the wrong person, and I wasnt worth their time.

"My understanding is that is that fungibility requires true anonymity/privacy.

While at a cursory glance, your 1 DAI seems like it should be 100% equivalent to my 1 DAI, this is not true upon closer inspection. There is a history of accounts/transactions associated with each, and these histories are not identical. Thus, if my 1 DAI was freshly minted, whereas yours was received from an account associated with various illegal activities, someone may choose to accept one over the other. 

As a result, the upshot is that any particular amount of DAI in one account may not be practically equivalent to the same amount of DAI in another. Thus not fungible."

"Bro I said it in a different comment but try the innerhour app. They have different types of meditation and you can set different goals (Be happier, sleep better, worry less, ect) All the meditations are guided by a lady helping you along, its been so great for me. I do most of them without the app now but not all meditation requires super focus and not thinking about anything, thats what I like about it. One of them called Guided Imagery they set you up with a way to think about a beautiful place to rest and now I come back to that place whenever I'm stressed or need to meditate.

"Using this thread to make a few more serious observations. 

Didn't think Santos was the right sub to close out the game. I would have used Ilsinho instead, for a bit more possession while remaining a threat. Maybe this view is colored by Santos doing quite a lot of the flopping late on, which seemed to be all he could contribute. 

The better the team gets, the more Gaddis shows up as a weak point. He gets high up the field but when he's there offers very little threat. Mostly he'll just make short passes to team mates. And getting up so high he can leave a lot of space behind. TFC didn't seem to have any effective wide players, so maybe the team was deliberately playing narrow at the back today. If that wasn't direct instruction, he was positionally all over the place today.

Przb had probably his best overall game. He's solidifying his place as the Burke replacement. He's showed he's not just a big target guy, he can create and lay off too. MOTM for me.

I'm really liking the midfield 4. I would still start Fabian over Aaronson for the guile, but it's good to have that choice. The #10 aside, the trio of Haris/Ale/Monteiro is looking really solid.

If DisCo doesn't do something about Pozuelo striking Trusty in the face, I give up. Our guys get suspensions and extra games tacked on for less.  In the modern game you can't have any contact to the face."

But I would actually suggest you use a battery buffer character (e.g. Cait, Selphie) if you want to use Layle as a member in your team. Kuja won't be a good member for launches as he don't store BRV.

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest you to use the team of Kuja, Beatrix and battery character like Cait should work. (I have did it before with Vaan, Beatrix and Cait). Just swap Layle for Kuja for the last wave. Kuja should help you to clear first 4 waves rather easily and the first half of the last wave. Save Beatrix Saint Cloth or Cait's battery skills for the launches. Remember have friend Layle apply Force debuff if you initiate the launches.

"The problems I am mentioning are intrinsic to government itself. You cannot expect a monopoly of violence to not abuse it. How that monopoly is organized or justified has no bearing on the fundamental matter; giving some people an exclusive right to use violence is inimical to human social development.

&gt; My point is that anarchism would inevitably lead to the formation of power hierarchies and in the end a monopolization will be created again. 

This is not true - or, at least, it flies in the face of what we understand about economics. Competition among providers does not lead to monopoly. If one group gets too large and begins abusing its market position, then competitors innovate and consumers switch to other groups. The game theoretical logic of markets is just that. Where we do see monopolies and cartels emerge are when governments prop up certain companies (banks), create monopolies themselves (public utilities), or create laws that effectively block competition (any company benefiting from intellectual property - a state-created privilege).

That groups of people will disagree with each other and ""clash"" over those disagreements doesn't mean that one group will reign supreme over the others. Dynamic equilibria emerge in all markets; there is no dominant, supreme winner of the athletic shoe market or the SUV market or even niche things like the graphics card market. Consumers demand good quality at low prices, and these firms compete on that basis. There is no reason to think markets in protection and adjudication would be any different.

There is plenty of good literature discussing the economics of a stateless society that dispels all sorts of fears about warlords taking over or the rich buying their own preferential justice system or whatever. Once this is understood, then belief in democracy becomes a naive faith and is seen as a form of political delusion. You can be your own sovereign person and live in harmony with others without being a slave to a ruling class. I hope that our Zen practice can help us continue shedding delusions wherever we encounter them and however long we have clung to them. If I am wrong in my position, then I hope I am cured of my false views."

Indian restaurants are probably few of them and knowing how spice intolerant Argentinians are the flavour will probably not resemble what you are used to at all. You will also probably struggle to find the spices to cook your own food as you are used to. If you are prone to feel homesick you will struggle due to culture shock.

"ojoj, vart ska man börja?

Varken Nordkorea eller Venezuela är socialistiskt. Nordkorea följer en ideologi som kallas för Juche, vilket är en (väldigt) modifierad version av Marxism-Leninismen. Venezuela har tidigare försökt att bygga socialism, ett försök som inte görs enklare av tariffer etc från tex USA. Hur denna utveckling ser ut nu och vad som kommer att hända är oklart. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Sverige olik dessa länder, tar inte socialismen på en fundamental nivå..

Vad betyder ens det? Sverige är ett kapitalistiskt land med en blandekonomi. De saker som allmän sjukvård, allmän skola, studiebidrag/lån etc är ""influenser"" av socialismen. Dessa saker är enligt mig det absolut bästa med Sverige. 

&amp;#x200B;

Angående frihet så kan jag enbart säga att jag har svårt att tro att den fattiga hemlösa personen känner sig speciellt ""fri"" när den tvingas jobba i princip dygnet runt utan fritid enbart för att överleva. I den fantasikapitalism du verkar förespråka är det inget konstigt. Förövrigt verkar du som de flesta andra inte ha en speciellt bra uppfattning av vad socialism är. Socialism innebär inte att staten tar allas pengar, det finns fortfarande löneskillnader etc. Den stora skillnaden är att i en socialistisk stat finns det ett skyddsnät för alla medborgare, som tar hand om de som inte har möjligheten att till exempel jobba, och produktionsfaktorerna övergår i folkets ägo. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jag uppmanar dig att plocka upp en bok och läsa lite mer angående olika socioekonomiska system. Du verkar inte ha speciellt bra koll."

"""Enjoy"" no. I don't particularly enjoy reading your comment, or many comments on reddit. In fact I find many comments hateful, though you might think differently.

That doesn't mean that I would prefer a world or reality that bends to my emotional fragility.

Our definitions of provocation and bigotry are likely vastly different. Since neither of us is completely objective, I don't think it's moral to enforce a subjective reality hrough corporate power structures as that would be at odds with human dignity. I think most people, most americans, would favor a sort of chaotic uncomfortable experience if given the choice between that and censorship."

"Copied from another of my comments:

Tiandi's defense is very mediocre and his offense is non-existant. It's nearly impossible for him to get into his strengths, chained 400ms lights, because of the lack of neutral threats he has since Palm Strike is completely reactable allowing the enemy to focus squarely on his heavies or opener lights to stop him from chaining. His stamina costs are extremely high as well, stopping what would be a good option select from being good, especially considering that this tier list weighs matchups vs other top tiers more heavily than bottom tiers, and the tops have strong OOS pressure for the most part.

Peacekeeper has a good zone option select and it's actually possible for her to get into her chained lights and maximum delayed bleed stab is almost decent offense."

"Seems like a lot of us have a common experience of being told that the harmless ways we enjoyed playing were still somehow wrong. We have to do the allistic play behaviors even if we are doing them totally joylessly.

Of course there are problems with the game, but they're always addressed and there's been a great effort to correct them. 

I think it's a bit silly to frame your opinion in such a way that casts unnecessary shade on the validity of the players' opinions. After all, they're the ones who give the feedback and are in the best position to comment on this.

The game ain't perfect. There were a lot of ridiculously embarrassing mistakes, for sure. But that doesn't mean they haven't stepped up their game in regards to communication--and that's really all I want to say."

"In the US, civil forfeiture is the seizure of property gained as the result of a crime, like a car bought with money earned form the sale of drugs. The police do not have the right to take OPs camera nor to even look at the pictures without a search warrant.

Taking pictures of anyone or anything in a public place is not illegal and that cop was abusing her power."

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"My opinion on Lebron and LeGM and LeCoach and all that has always been the same: I'm not the biggest fan of it in a vacuum. I don't think the way that operates is usually ideal. However when it comes to LBJ, fan or not of the practice, you **100% do it** if he's in a badly run organization like the Cavs or Lakers (Miami was a different story). It's still your best chance of winning.

It's same way I always say I'm not a big fan of the way Lebron plays and his system. Because despite the fact that people always says he's pass first and unselfish, while true, he's also very ball dominant and makes sure all decision making on court stays with him. It creates an offense where Lebron always has the ball in his hand and you got 4 guys just standing around ready to catch and shoot, with the wrinkle of having a #2 playmaker (Kyrie/Wade) who will take playmaking responsibility 25% of the time. Jordan worked within Phil Jackson's system. Lebron *is* the system.

But again, all that being said, if he's on your team: **You 100% construct your team around his preferred playstyle.** You seen what he likes and what works. Instead Magic and Rob LowePlinka decided to buck analytics and trends in the last 10 years and go ""old school"" tough guy play makers instead of shooters.

So even though I wasn't a huge fan of his passive aggressive ""LeGM"" moments in Cleveland, given how terrible and dysfunctional the Lakers are right now, if I was a Laker fan, I would gladly turn over the keys to LeGM over Jeanie Buss and the Rambis's."

If you cant see the difference between 480p, 512i or 720p video on the Go thats fine, I can and dont like the way 480p looks.

I posted the technical explanation from the Lead software engineer at Oculus who design the and programmed a lot of the Oculus SDK that all the apps use, and the netflix app as well, so we know for a fact that the netflix VR app on the Go is only showing 480p video.

If you are happy with the if, well use it and enjoy it.  I find the quality to distracting, so chose to either watch on my TV or watch my own rips instead. Thats one of the good things about the Go, there is more than one app or way to watch stuff on, and if one dose not work for you, you are free to try a different one instead. :-)"

When they are heated, in the vape, they are actually chemically altered as well depending on the details required to do so as what comes out is water and another derivative chemical of the compounds generally used to suspend nicotine.

I only meant to clarify. I wasn't sure if you were implying that our natural breath doesn't go as far because of the minute difference between our breath and the surrounding air. Cause we still breath out more CO2 dense and water vapor dense air which, if the metric that you used to determine how far this vapor cloud should go is based on inertia from density, then I'd imagine our breaths would still travel further even than just air circulated via mechanical means.

So are you saying that our breaths don't go as far due to having a lower density than vape clouds?"

Is it all Fantasy the way you describe? Is all other fiction without that? I don't think so. But I think this is relevant to your fantasy and why people like heroic tales. Might someone else had put it better elsewhere. Maybe...

But honest enthusiasm should count for something. 

""A world that shows them even ordinary people can do extraordinary things if they act with courage, kindness, and honor. And with a little reflection, some of them will realize, one day, that there isn't much of a difference between the fear their heroes felt and the fear they're feeling about the world they escape from. So long as we give them those heroes and keep their spirit alive, we will all benefit from it.""

I can go with that.

Hell I write to entertain, but I also write in the hope that sometimes, in a small way, I might affect people to be better. That I will take from writing somethings that will make myself better. Yeah, I wil go with what you said there. Should a writer take a moment of pride, and maybe a little hubris, to think that yes that works?

Without that sort of optimism, why bother?If you don't celebrate the optimism and whatever success you find? Where do you find the joy? Where does a writer experience success? If it is just in a sale, that is far more shallow.

2. They used terminology that demonized the subject of their statement.

Your comment clearly stated why (2) is wrong. However, their bigger error was in how badly they misunderstood Woodford's central thesis. He claimed that MTF athletes competing in women's sports have an overwhelming competitive advantage over women who belong to the traditional female mode of the largely bimodal human population.

&gt;First: The definition I offered to most who asked me for it was: Faith is trust of belief in the truth of something without enough argument/evidence to shift the burden of proof and/or arguments/evidence against it. That definition is probably flawed, but it was/is the best I could come up with.

​Ok. So I can agree with most of your definition, except for the part about ""shifting the burden of proof.""

Let's be clear. The burden of proof is ALWAYS on the person making the claim that controverts the status quo. I'll elaborate:

There is no relation between X and Y, until the relation between X and Y is demonstrated.

Dillahunty says it meaner than I do. His wrap-up summary after hanging up on the caller is perfect for this conversation.
https://youtu.be/yICsS8CX4wQ

The only way to ""shift"" this burden, is to provide repeatable, demonstrable evidence for the claim; something theists have yet to do regarding the existence of God.

Despite that objection, I'd say we are in close enough agreement to proceed with faith defined as: belief without reasonable certainty.

I should have also defined axioms as well.

-Axiom: An established rule or principle or *self-evident* truth.

Note the ""self-evident"" factor. This is the component that faith is missing, and precisely why it is not the same thing as an axiom.

&gt;I think you are right about most of your criticism. I think what the solipsim problem and the cause-and-effect problem show to me is that the deep mechanics of reason are, in the end, unjustifiable.

No. It is absolutely NOT unjustifiable. You saw the stone fall 99 times. You would be completely justified in claiming that it would fall to the ground the next time you let it go.

You have 99 reasons to support the claim the stone will fall.
You have 0 reasons to believe the claim the stone will float.

Therefore, the claim that ""stones fall when you let them go"" would be an axiom. It thus far has been *proven* to be self-evident.

Even if the stone *does* float on the 100th drop, you would have been justified in presuming that it was going to fall. Up until the point that it doesn't fall, you will always be justified in expecting the stone to fall again.

&gt;I am not sure what evidence we would have either way - I think there is no evidence either for OR against solipsism

-Solipsism: ​a theory holding that the self can know nothing but its own modifications and that the self is the only existent thing

The somewhat paradoxical nature of solipsism poisons anything that could be taken as evidence one way or the other, true.

But I think you're getting caught up in this concept to an intellectually debilitating degree by setting an unreasonably high standard of proof. One that both you and I demonstrated is not compatible with personal progress; why should either of us go to work when we're discussing the very nature of existence? Why is it that we both see that as the more reasonable prioritization, and not the other way around?

&gt;Ok, but I think I still get from this that reason bottoms out. There is no final justification that it works, or that its mechanisms are fully reliable. I think.

That's the paralysis of solipsism​, the unreasonably high standard of proof. It's a dead-end. Enter axioms.

&gt;I am not sure why you say that the acceptance that there is a difference between good and bad is an axiom, or what work that claim is supposed to do.

I'm not sure that I did say that, nor do I believe that. I'll have to look back and see how that came off that way.

Morality *could* be quasi-relative regarding less egregious acts. This can be resolved through simple dialogue. However, I don't believe there is/was a single culture that permitted murder, rape, theft, torture, perjury, etc.

Good/Bad are relative to the well-being of individuals and their communities.

&gt;If an axiom is just a statement that is taken to be true without sufficient proof as a starting point for further reasoning (which seems to be the way you use it?)

This definition is missing the *self-evident* component that I failed to explain prior to this comment. The ""without sufficient proof"" is also fundamental error in your understanding here.

So the big question then, is the existence of god.

As far as we know, that question can only have one answer. Either he does exist, or he does not exist. As of right now, there is no way of being reasonably certain that he does or does not. Which one to choose then?

Ask yourself, is it better to believe something *after it's proven true,* or *until it is proven false?* Which approach would result in a more accurate understanding of reality?

Hint: It's the first one. I could believe *anything* if I took the second option. 

&gt;then why aren't ""god exists"" ""god wants x"" etc. also axioms just (at least in my opinion) less useful ones?

Because, ""god exists"" is not a *self-evident* claim. The claim is simply an assertion without evidence.

This would be like me saying, ""The stone has fallen 99/99 times so far. Therefore, I can be reasonably certain that it will float the 100th time I drop it. It should be glaringly obvious why this is an unsupported assumption.

I could also say at the beginning of the process, ""The stone has fallen 0/0 times, therefore I believe the stone will fall.""

Logically, both claims are unfounded. However, not *equally* so; as there is evidence to contradict my claim in the first example, and there is no evidence to contradict, OR lend credence to the claim in the second example.

Food for thought: These examples do not say what planet the speaker is on, or if they are even on a planet at all. As observers, we most likely assume the speaker is on Earth because we are. Imagine you found yourself in some alternate dimension where stones fell up. You'd have to throw out all your axiomatic principles regarding physics and start from scratch.

""god wants x"" is even worse! It's an unfounded claim founded upon another unfounded claim. A logical nightmare.

Firstly, it *presupposes* the existence of god. Something that is not logically self-evident, as we can (hopefully) agree. So not only are we starting at an arbitrary, unfounded point for which we have no good reason to start at, but now the statement is claiming intimate knowledge of the desires of this non-evident being.

This raises a multitude of logical challenges not worth pursuing at this time. Unless you can contradict my claim that there is no evidence for the existence of this ""god"" being. By all means, give me an explanation or ""evidence"" you are willing to entertain as a possibility and we can go from there.

&gt;So maybe we need to determine when believe in axioms is faith and when it is not.

I think I addressed the axiom/faith difference enough in this post already. So I'll just move past this and hope we both understand why this statement is incorrect now.

&gt;Maybe this works by distinguishing ""acceptance"" from ""belief"",

That could work, the problem is getting everyone on the same page with using the same terminology to better convey what they mean. I found this clip of Matt Dillahunty speaking with a theist who was making a similar argument to yours.

https://youtu.be/L2dmqYcTQbk


&gt;with acceptance being that you do not believe, but for other reasons, you decide to act AS IF you believed (as in: I will accept, for now, that you did not eat the cake, but I really think you did, but I cannot prove it, so I will keep acting as if I thought you didn't).

​To this I can only ask, why would you *want* to?

In your cake scenario, pretending the person didn't eat the cake is largely inconsequential. But as an analogy to believing in the existence of God, it's an apples and oranges fallacy. The stakes on the latter are immeasurably higher than who ate the [replaceable] cake.

This reminds me of a theist who told me that eternal condemnation to Hell was basically like being grounded by your parents. The argument is intellectually dishonest, even if you aren't.

&gt;So then we could say that religious people have faith because they believe in a bunch of god-related axioms.

No, we could not. They have *unfounded* presuppositions plucked from thin air, which are not based upon any *evident truths.*

&gt;And I have faith because I believe in a bunch of reason-related axioms, among them the axiom that good and bad exists

No, you don't have *faith* that good and bad exist, you have *evidence* that they do. (I.e. History, a moral compass, empathy, learned judgment) It is from that *evidence* that you can be *reasonably certain* that good/bad exist. And from that reasonable certainty, you are able to employ your agency to act/assess accordingly upon your understanding of good and bad.

&gt;human reason is the right kind of tool to find something out about it?

Yes. Hell yes.

Here's a few more videos I think you'd enjoy. I recommend Sam Harris because of his neuroscience background, and because he doesn't come off quite as aggressively as Matt Dillahunty or others. Though I also recommend checking out more clips of The Atheist Experience as well.

"&gt; i would not be able to use them to (As an example) functionally replace the feed line between the antenna and transciever, because that feed line needs to carry the full power sent by the transceiver, right?

That's correct, but I think you have a conceptual misunderstanding as well. Those wireless audio devices are designed to carry an audio-frequency signal over a FM link. They are not capable of carrying some other RF signal over a FM link. We're talking about dozens of kilohertz versus dozens or hundreds of megahertz.

Now, you could locate the whole transceiver at the antenna, using your audio transmitter for audio, and some solution for wireless rig control, e.g. USB connection to a Raspberry Pi on your WiFi network. But all of that will be much more hassle than just running coax feedline from your transceiver to the antenna.

The only plausible use those things have to a ham radio beginner is what they were designed for: a short-range wireless audio link.

&gt; That being said, could i theoretically use this for stupidly low wattage QRP testing? looks like most of those are set to 20-30mW

30 mW is low even by QRP standards and it'll be quite challenging to get any appreciable distance (hence why these devices are license-free in the first place). On top of that, FM is not the best mode for QRP. Challenges are great of course, but it might be frustrating for your first project as a ham! For $25 you can get a Baofeng UV-5R, like practically every new ham gets these days. It will do 5W on the 2m and 70cm bands, which should be enough to hit the repeaters around town even using the stock antenna.

&gt; can't make large modification to house for antennas since we rent

There are a lot of designs out there for apartment / stealth / HOA-friendly antennas. ARRL has some publications. Remember that higher frequency means smaller wavelength, which means smaller antennas. Working VHF/UHF from a small space is much easier than working HF, but either can be done. On VHF/UHF you can use a mag mount vehicle antenna, [build a yagi from hardware store parts](http://theleggios.net/wb2hol/projects/rdf/tape_bm.htm) or [make a vertical dipole from a piece of coax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tafy51yUzQo).

&gt; would i need to worry about SWR since there's that air gap between the antenna and transceiver?

Any time two RF devices are connected, e.g. the amplifier and the antenna, you have the possibility of impedance mismatch and bad SWR."

"“The Night King wouldn’t risk any direct encounters with people holding Valyrian steel or dragonglass, he’d just be jeopardizing everything”

So why not just have wights or other walkers kill Bran while he chills in a safe location? Why walk into a courtyard in a castle that has multiple people with the weapons that can kill you? If he wanted to kill bran himself he could have literally had him wheeled the fuck out of the castle to his safe location lol.

This stupid excuse doesn’t hold any water. The Night King acted the way he did out of plot convenience, not caution."

"I don't have personal experience with any of this, but from my understanding of the subject, I think they just botched it.

The ""Menace 1"" part of the callsign refers to the fact that whenever you send a team out, that team is given the callsign ""Menace 1."" Since you only have one team in the field at any given moment (no matter how many you may have aboard the Avenger,) you will never have a ""Menace 2/Menace 3/etc.""

That being said - again, if I understand all of this correctly - Menace 1-6 should be whichever one of your soldiers has field command of the unit. And 1-5 would be the next in line. This is kind of screwed around with because the player is both... well, the player, but also a character in the game itself. So the player-as-Commander is probably thought of as Menace 1-6, because they're in overall charge of the mission. Only, you know, they wouldn't be, because the Commander doesn't actually GO on field ops...

Yeah, it's kind of a mess."

"In order to do such a thing they have to be willing to not only lose their family connections but also connections to most if not all of their friends.

Even people who aren’t public figures and left a cult have a hard time revealing their identity when talking about what happened in the cult."

Name them.
Yea... what a bra she has there
It’s actually the only right take given the definition and the etymology.
"If you played when you said you did, then you would know there have been massive changes to the way the game works. The talent system from the pre release beta-Wrath of the Lich King has been removed for a decade, some builds from classic are completely non viable such as Elemental Mage or 2H Enhancement Shaman. It's not ""just nostalgia"", we've been playing classic for over a decade on private realms."
I was the same way but I'm working on it. I used to be able to go out alone but when I started getting anxiety attacks I wasn't able to anymore (maybe for 4 or 5 years) I'm barely getting over it. I would have ridiculous paranoid thoughts that something would happen to me and my family wouldn't find out for hours. There's more to it but I won't bore you all with the details.
I think it was in sideshow's vod review stream a while ago and Hex said he has to pretend to be interested in goats meta while casting. Maybe he should act better.
The man is worried about his golem. Leave him alone :(

"Ah, that would makes everything even more sweet. If your a evil-ish DM like myself, you could have the Templar’s always be one step ahead. The party may get small victories (and this is important for player fun) but while the characters were burning down that one building, Templar assassins were killing the smuggler lord that the group was relying on to get weapons for the resistance. The king will always know what is going to happen because the group will always report to him.

You want to drop little hints every now and again, so when the final battle ensues and the king betrays them the party says, “I should have know!”  I recommend watching How to be a Great GM’s video on creating a nemesis villain if you want to do this for your king."

"Heh, no joke about the cost.  I doubt any of us lowly engineers who worked there would have dropped the $2.5k to get one.  And our profit margins were... not really existent.  Turns out it really does cost a lot of money to design your own Intel compatible motherboard... and keyboard... and case... and RF... _and battery pack_ entirely from scratch.

You're *so right* about active cooling being teh suck, and more oomph == more heat.  (when things were in development... ""unit caught fire AGAIN"" was a not rare bug report from QA)

Also, I hadn't realized how thin you really kept it.  With the normal battery I think we were around 23mm?    But everyone used the double size battery anyway which was thicker (but 9000mah).   So bravo to you at 15mm WOW.

I wonder where your biggest power draw is.  The screen?  The radios?  The keyboard?  The CPU?  My gut says you should be able to get way more than 4h out of 3000mah.  But my gut can be wrong of course.  The product was never released as the company went under right before ship time, but the 2+ that used OLED drew *much* less power, so I wonder if that could help.  (Can one even buy off the shelf OLEDs and not have to build your own frigging LVDS driver?  I wonder...)

Anyway, BRAVO again, and aww shucks thanks, glad you liked our (failed...) product."

I don’t talk to many ppl, I keep to myself a lot, but if someone who I’ve never met gives me a high five in the hall way or congratulate me bc of last nights game I’ll definitely high five back and/or say thank you w/a real smile.

"Most of it grew along the ground instead of down! I’d say about the first 8-12” were growing vertically, then it turned back on itself like a J shape. The rest was only about 3-4” deep, so it pulled out very easily.

"I remember reading in John Adams' biography by David McCullough that he held his defense of the accused in the Boston Massacre trial as the greatest service he ever rendered to his country, even after having played such a crucial role in the Revolution in the diplomatic service and after his term as the second president of the US.

Similarly, Jefferson's epitaph contains no mention to the two terms he served as president -- it only mentions his authorship of the Declaration of Independence and of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom (which inspired the First Amendment), and his founding of the University of Virginia.

It is instructive that what these men believed to be their greatest achievements is generally not what they are best known for by other people."
"&gt; the MSQ ends up being a trivial amount of your total playtime.

Yep. That's the point. It's an annoyance more than anything else.

I have a lot of friends who joined and quit solely because of how bad the MSQ is. No one wants a mandatory 120 fetch quests.

I'll never forget the quest Minfilia gives me to go tell her mom to pack. For real?! I'm the Warrior of Light, and of all the plebs who work under her, she chose ME to do that?

Just cut the quests in half, double the XP rewards, and it might be more tolerable."
The US isn't the problem
"Just because I can't believe I'm still thinking about this, I'm gonna throw my thought process out here. 

It kind of looks like the cloth is wrapped around the center piece and falls on either side... which made me think of a manual drill, but the way that it's threaded through those smaller pieces makes it impossible for it to rotate freely, so that's out. 

I can't quite figure out what that diagonal piece on the right would be-- it seems to be the same material as the rest of the machine, and doesn't look mobile, so its angle means the plates don't move. Someone else thought it might be a hand crank, but it doesn't seem to make sense to me that way.

I keep coming back to the shape of the plates... they seem oddly familiar to me, but I can't for the life of me think of where I might've seen something similar before. But none of the medieval machinery I've found so far is really anything but round or cross-shaped, which makes me think that the shape is significant somehow."
"... hence the self awareness bit. We progressed far enough to realize it was a bad thing, but not enough to recognize that we're *still* doing bad shit. To use my earlier analogy, it's like the ex-junkie support group leader really did quit shooting heroin, but now they're a closet alcoholic."

"I am not projecting on to you solely, while I agree that this specific argument is very valid. My only problem being that it isn’t in the Quran.

I have not qualms with people leveling factual and logical critical against the religion. I actually agree with your end point. Muhammad was not a good person. I just wanted to get on a bit of a soap box about how Jesus wasn’t a good person either according to purely historical texts and saying Islam is terrible and evil because Muhammad was bad while following the teachings of Jesus or Abraham, two arguably morally inconsistent people, it is not absurd to feel that is may not be a good faith argument."

"Battalion, Vanguard, and Outrider detachments. 10CP, 2000 points, 107 PL.

- Cadre Fireblade, two Ethereals, and a Coldstar Commander.

- Two squads of 8 Fire Warriors and a squad of 8 Breachers.

- Two squads of 5 Pathfinders.

- Two squads of 7 Shield Drones.

- Two squads of 3 Sniper Drones.

- Two Firesight Marksmen.

- A squad of 3 XV9 Hazard Suits with double-barelled burst cannons and advanced targeting systems.

- A squad of 3 XV9 Hazard Suits with fusion cascades and shield generators.

- Two Riptides with heavy burst cannons, SMS missiles, advanced targeting systems, and velocity tracker.

I'm using Vior'la instead of T'au sept because I'm not a fan of the static gun line. The lack of named characters kinda hurts, but sitting castled up with Shadowsun for two turns isn't as fun.

The Hazard Suits give up Gang Busters, but they're so much fun to advance and shoot. The double-barelled burst cannons are for infantry (48 S5 shots -1AP with ATS), and the cascade fusion are for tougher targets (6 D3 S8 -4AP, shield generators for 4+ inv).

I plan to use the Pathfinders for engineers (helps to have the stratagem to move 2D6 in the shooting phase, giving up shooting/charging).

Plan is to keep the Fire Warriors with the Cadre Fireblade on one side, and the Breachers with an Ethereal pushing the other side. Hot Blooded stratagem when I need to shoot a squad twice.

"With copulative verbs (such as to be), the agreement usually isn't so clear (in lots of languages, actually, not only in English). As far as I know, the common thing is to agree the verb with the precedent element (so, in this case, it should be as you mention): ""The source of Indian civilization is the people who called themselves the Aryans"", but you could say ""The people who called themselves the Aryans are the source of Indian Civilization"" as well if you inverted the sentence. 

I do not really know, though, how ""sanctioned"" each use is, but if you want to play it safe I would say just agree the verb with the first element, whether it is the subject or the complement (another distinction that isn't always easy to make)."

"Oh, its not cut corners. A generic drug has enough dosage to be equal to original mfg. Don't forget, if an original mfg says 100mg it means that amount  but the body just uses 75mg (nobody really knows how much it uses different for every  body), the generic med has to contain enough of treatment drug to do the same as original. It could be that generic mfg uses inactive ingredients which dissolve better to serve the treatment; the other generic mfg uses different ingredients which do the job but not as well or efficiently. Every body is different, treatments are like throw against a wall and see what sticks."

Unlike what the media shows, a lot of Spanish speakers also have rudimentary understanding of English. Most people speak a second language; the exception are Americans. 

&gt;Plan on spending money when they get there, not looking for tax payer backed support

Most of the refugees coming from Central America are not asking for tax payer backed support. They just want to be considered for asylum. They're refugees. They are willing to uproot their lives to find safety.

Those Americans in that caravan are not refugees. They are seeking to take advantage of another country's system. The same way they go on ""Medical Tourism"" to other countries. They go to Mexico for dental work. They go to South America for surgeries. They go to Southeast Asia for skincare. Most of those countries have healthcare systems paid for by the the taxes of those countries citizens.

Candians pay the taxes are what keep those insulin prices low. It's part of their healthcare system. They are subsizing that ""Canadian Caravan"". It's literally tax payer backed support, but I guess it's okay since it's not American tax dollars.

"It’s not about gameplay balance bud, this is about the thematic integrity of the series. Health has been a resource in many games, Hearthstone is one for example. You equip weapons and then trade. It can very easily be balanced and would work perfectly in an action game, especially one wherein the sacrifice of one’s own being and humanity is the cost for strength like in Berserk. But....it’s not in DMC, that premise is routinely shown to be a fallacy in that world, and DMC isn’t about Berserker style combat either. 

It’s about never getting touched. The moment you lose health you have lost something and made a sacrifice or made a mistake. Even tanking hits is used lightly in DMC with the Dreadnaught move which is viewed as a crutch for those who cannot royal guard. Cavalier has an alt which takes away super armour. DMC is about being as cool and stylish as possible without ever showing a sign of weakness or mortality. The moment you do you’ve failed. The idea that Dante would trade his life force to kill a mundane demon is preposterous."

"No, the Royal Navy specifically made entry into their commissioned ranks subject to an examination process after a period of apprenticeship. I wrote about this in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/29f3s7/how_does_the_royal_navys_organisation_command/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7wn2vn/marquis_de_lafayette_was_an_officer_at_the_age_of/du28aww/). To quote from the second answer: 

&gt; The custom for men to start learning their trade at sea as boys dated back to at least the early 17th century in Britain, but it was not at all evenly applied -- many officers started as midshipmen, but others were simply commissioned as officers, and there was a notable difference, and to an extent a social divide, in the ""tarpaulin"" officers promoted from the ranks of seamen and the ""gentleman"" officers promoted due to social standing. The tension between them stemmed in part from their relative expertise at sea, and the difference between having learned the trade through apprenticeship versus being appointed directly to command. In December 1677, Charles II took the crucial decision of requiring potential lieutenants to pass an examination, offered by a board of captains, to receive their commissions.

&gt; This hasn't attracted as much attention in British historiography as it probably should, because it is at its heart a socially revolutionary requirement -- gentlemen having to prove their competence was new; before this, they were assumed to be competent because of their birth.

&gt; The need to spend time at sea to gain the experience necessary to pass that examination, and the related requirement that potential lieutenants spend time at sea, is what made the midshipman's rank necessary for entering as an officer. What changed in early- to mid-18th century was that navigation, particularly finding longitude, required a decent knowledge of mathematics and astronomy, and it was also thought to be useful to have at least some rudimentary other schooling for young officers, so boys might go to sea for a year or two then spend time ashore to learn mathematics. Being kept on the ship's books to earn sea-time was a convenience -- though it was technically illegal, it was licit and accepted practice in the RN.

&gt; This certainly wasn't restricted to the wealthy or connected -- the greatest admiral of the age was a country parson's son from Norfolk.

I would also add that purchasing a commission was only an entrance into the Army -- although men would have to pay for their commissions as they advanced in rank, no-one was buying a marshal's baton. Arthur Wellington, the victor of Waterloo and first duke of Wellesley, entered as an ensign."

I’m showing an Electrify America charger in Georgetown and one in Eastland and another in Sweetwater. This means the furthest between chargers is 168 miles (to satisfy that 170 mile figure you pulled out of your butt) and even better, everyone one of them can charge an E-Tron at 150kW which is not only faster than the level 2 charging 12 hours you claimed but faster than Tesla Supercharging as well.

I walked home on a similar night but it had more fog. I was about a quarter mile from home when I heard soft footsteps behind me that never overtook me. I looked around and saw no one. I stopped and they stopped. I walked on and they followed. I stopped again...and the soft footsteps stopped.  I walked again and stopped quickly in mid-stride.  As I lifted my foot I discovered the source of the footsteps. The tops of my canvas shoes made a soft popping sound as they were flexed and then snapped back flat in the echoing fog around me.

What kind of stupid fucking question is that? I don’t understand why the fuck people in this fan base feel like they have to decide between liking Kevin and liking steph.

Books, Film and Music are mediums that can move from generation to generation, physical to digital without compromising the ownership or usability of the product.

&amp;#x200B;

Video games aren't treated with the respect they deserve, they aren't treated as the serious medium they are, they are treated like disposable toys. 

&amp;#x200B;

We shouldn't be accepting this practice for games, what about future generations that want to explore and enjoy these products?

&amp;#x200B;

What if N64 games just stopped working after 10 years?

"People who do not care about policies, honestly, are fair game. Try logos first, but then go ethos and pathos for the rest.

Some people do not care about policies but they still vote. People who care about policies need to convince them as well."
I’m not sure how you came to that conclusion but it seems like you have an agenda that can’t be changed. Not sure why you’re in this sub.
Reduce the decay on the kick gate (assuming you used one) EQ out a notch in the kick that the ear buds rattle on (try a few different sets of buds to make sure yours don't have a mechanical defect) drop the kick level a bit or limit it's  peaks a bit. That's what I would try.

I'm still annoyed at them for being petty, but it really makes it clear that it's NOT about you - it's about them. 

By not bringing it up going forward, you're basically being sensitive to a shortcoming of theirs. Think of it as a charity. =)"
What genre of dog is thad
"Exactly. Animals that coexist within human society as companions or work animals (dogs, cats, horses, and so on) get a much higher degree of legal protection than other animals. And humans get the highest level of protection because we *are* society. ""Society"" is just humans working together to advance our common interests as humans."

&gt; # [AntidominGoT. Los rituales atrás de la última serie que veremos todos juntos](https://bucket2.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/53/2930853.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt;     Nos encerramos para que nadie nos spoilee lo que sigue, hacemos banquetes acorde y debatimos hasta la madrugada; así vivimos la última temporada de Game of Thrones Crédito: Marcelo Gómez Quienes sufrimos del ""síndrome de domingo"", eso que pasa cuando se pone el sol y las neuronas se organizan para hacernos creer que no fuimos lo suficientemente felices durante el fin de semana que está por terminar, estamos viviendo nuestro mejor momento. Al menos hasta el 19 de mayo, cuando termine [Game of Thrones](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/game-of-thrones-tid51017) para siempre y ya no haya excusas para salir de la posición fetal hasta que amanezca de nuevo. Es que la serie, que está en su última temporada, generó como pocas la necesidad de organizarse frente a la pantalla, sea de a dos, de a veinte o de a mil. Dentro de algunos años, la última escena de la batalla de Winterfell competirá en el recuerdómetro con la de Javier Mascherano diciéndole a Sergio Romero [""hoy te convertís en héroe""](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/deportes/futbol/cuatro-anos-despues-sergio-romero-revelo-que-le-dijo-javier-mascherano-antes-del-hoy-te-convertis-en-heroe-nid2122184). Y los más memoriosos sabrán decir en dónde estaban, a quién abrazaron y qué estaban tomando.
&gt; 
&gt; En América Latina, la adaptación de David Benioff y D.B. Weiss de las novelas de George R.R. Martin tuvo un récord de 30 millones de streams (vistas) solo en los primeros dos episodios de la temporada 8, que está en curso, a través de HBO, HBO GO, HBO On Demand y demás plataformas. Eso solo en América Latina. Y no hay datos oficiales, pero podemos asegurar que el 99% de los que le dieron play lo hicieron porque están muy comprometidos con el show y no porque ""lo engancharon en el cable"" y se quedaron.
&gt; 
&gt;    [El exterior de Diggs Palermo pintado para la ocasión](https://bucket2.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/53/2930853w380.jpg)El exterior de Diggs Palermo pintado para la ocasión Fuente: AFP - Crédito: Patricio Pidal No quedan series como Game of Thrones por un montón de motivos. Uno es que gran parte de las que vemos ahora se estrenan de una, largando temporadas enteras para que se vean a la velocidad que uno quiera.
&gt; 
&gt; Algunos que no consumían series antes de Netflix experimentan la espera por primera y quizás única vez con GoT. Es el caso de Federico Furman, de 30 años: ""Me junto siempre con mi novia y una pareja amiga a comer y ver el capítulo. Es la primera vez que me engancho con una serie así donde pasa una semana entre cada emisión. Las otras las vi mucho más rápido"".
&gt; 
&gt; Esas que se suben enteras las podemos comentar en el almuerzo del trabajo, pero las chances de que todos estemos en el mismo capítulo son pocas. El crítico de cine y TV Matt Zoller Seitz lo resumió en un artículo del sitio Vulture que se titula [""¿Es Game of Thrones el último show que vamos a ver juntos?""](https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/game-of-thrones-the-last-show-we-watch-together.html): ""Hoy en día, la conversación online alrededor de las series de streaming existe, pero de una forma diferente. Si un programa es tendencia en Twitter, es probable que sea porque la gente ya vio la serie completa y la quiere recomendar a otros y no porque quiera experimentar un mismo momento con otra gente"".
&gt; 
&gt; Otro motivo es que crecimos y vimos crecer a los personajes. Al ser una producción tan enorme -el presupuesto de los primeros episodios era de casi cinco millones de dólares cada uno, mientras los de la octava ya escalan a 15 millones-, las temporadas tardan decenas de meses en filmarse y editarse, lo que hace que conozcamos a los personajes desde hace más de ocho años. Por la manera en que se fue construyendo la historia, los vimos pasar por muchos momentos. Hasta nos cansamos de ellos, los odiamos y los volvimos a querer. No hay consenso sobre nadie y el debate es infinito.
&gt; 
&gt; Finalmente, está el factor de la complejidad del universo que cuenta. En este aspecto, está más cerca de Star Wars que de cualquier serie que se haya estrenado en los últimos diez años. La mayoría solo encuentra paralelismos en otro boom fantástico televisivo y adictivo: Lost. No es fácil seguirle el ritmo a GoT, aunque sean poquísimos episodios por temporada (esta última tiene solo seis) y eso permite que se expanda una red que lo contiene.
&gt; 
&gt; ##  Merchandising y banquetes 
&gt; 
&gt;    [Diggs es uno de los bares que se presta para los encuentros de domingo](https://bucket1.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/51/2930851w380.jpg)Diggs es uno de los bares que se presta para los encuentros de domingo Fuente: AFP - Crédito: Patricio Pidal ""Seguí otras series muy a full, como Mad Men o Breaking Bad, pero esta es número uno, porque además me llevó a consumir mucho más por fuera de la serie. Compro casi todo lo que haya: libros, series, cómics, blogs, podcasts"", cuenta Juan Manuel Puente, de 38 años, que todos los domingos espera a dormir a sus tres hijos para darle play al capítulo por Cablevisión Flow, cerca de las 23.
&gt; 
&gt; Mientras el [ritual](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tema/habitos-tid48837) de Juan es privado, con su esposa, Carolina, y los ronquidos de los chicos de fondo, otros eligen encuentros más grandes. Todos lo califican como antidomingo (antidominGoT, para hablar con propiedad). Carolina Salem, que festejó su cumpleaños de 29 la noche del segundo capítulo de esta temporada, cuenta: ""No suelo festejar, pero este año cayó un domingo y justo coincidía con un capítulo bastante esperado. Me pareció un gran plan cenar y después mirarlo todos juntos. Lo mejor de todo fue que un grupo de amigas que ni conocen la serie cayó al lugar con máscaras de Arya, Bran y Jon Snow y también con unos vasos customizados"".
&gt; 
&gt; Hablando de merchandising, la edición especial que hizo Johnnie Walker de su whisky -White Walker, una botella que cambia con el frío y tiene a su icónico caballero disfrazado de personaje de la serie- lideró en Mercado Libre la categoría de esta bebida durante la semana del estreno de Game of Thrones.
&gt; 
&gt; También en el plano casero, Julián Barouille, de 24, y sus amigos tienen toda una ceremonia los domingos. Se pusieron como objetivo cocinar carnes salvajes (guiño a uno de los grupos humanos más queridos de la serie) y aprender juntos. Así, hicieron pulpo ""a la Greyjoy"" (nombre de una de las casas en disputa), conejo, cordero y esperan coronar con un ciervo en la final.
&gt; 
&gt; ""No está tan definido el concepto, pero la idea es que nos mueva para ir a comprar las cosas, buscar recetas, aprender y pasar la tarde juntos. Cada semana nos preguntan más personas si se pueden sumar y mientras haya lugar y comida son todos bienvenidos"", cuenta Julián.
&gt; 
&gt; ##  Con hinchada real y virtual 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Es como estar en el cine"", define Vanessa Fernández, de 28 años, que se asegura de reservar mesa con anticipación en algún bar para no quedarse sin lugar para ella y su amiga Paula. ¿Lo que más le gusta? La emoción de la gente que la hace entusiasmarse todavía más por la trama. Sentado frente a la pantalla gigante montada en el bar Diggs de Palermo momentos antes de la proyección del capítulo 4 de la última temporada, Jerónimo Repetto, de 27, dice: ""Una vez que vivís la experiencia de verlo así, no querés volver a una casa. La gente se ceba mucho, cuando arranca hay un silencio total y en los momentos épicos se vuelve tipo partido de fútbol"".
&gt; 
&gt; Desde la temporada pasada, cada vez más bares y centros culturales de todo el mundo decidieron abrir sus puertas para los fanáticos en esa noche que normalmente no atrae a mucha gente. Al preguntarles a los entrevistados si por alguna otra razón saldrían con tanto ímpetu un domingo, la respuesta negativa es unánime. ""No solemos salir la última noche del fin de semana, venimos acá por la serie. Somos como 15 todas las semanas que nos juntamos en un bar, tomamos y picamos algo"", cuenta Henry Calderón.
&gt; 
&gt; Yendo al un clima más masivo, hubo y habrá eventos oficiales alrededor de los capítulos como la GoT Watch Party organizada por HBO junto a la periodista Fiorella Sargenti para el primer capítulo de la temporada (con 50 fanáticos invitados en un pequeño castillo con decoración acorde) y el más grande de Cablevisión Flow, donde la Facultad de Derecho de la UBA se llenó de White Walkers, caballeros luchando y banquete acorde con 300 invitados. Para el final de la serie, el 19 de mayo, HBO organizó una GOTFest en Buenos Aires (algo que en Sudamérica solo se repetirá en México). El evento, de entrada gratuita -acceden quienes participen de diferentes concursos y actividades de las operadoras de TV-, tendrá lugar para 1500 personas y actividades desde las 14, con juegos, tronos imitación de los reales y, obviamente, la proyección del episodio.

"Maybe there are people pretending, but to assume every trans person may be pretending is not fair. The trans community isn’t treated well, and it’s hard to put up with all of that, especially if it isn’t your truth. I’m sure some people do it (whether purposely lying or because gender can be confusing and some people jump around different labels until they find one that fits best), but definitely not the majority. It’s not my place to say whether or not a person is really trans. That’s up to the individual, perhaps a therapist, and maybe a doctor if they feel the need. 

However, I don’t think this is a fad since there is documentation of trans people and non-binary people existing throughout history (particularly outside of Europe) [Here](https://international.ucla.edu/burkle/article/139796) is a pretty good graphic that breaks it down. I personally find it interesting that so many different cultures developed similar ideas about gender (although they were suppressed later on)."

What? It is?
"You lay yourself to rest, the knife set on the bedside table again.

You wake up in the castle again, this time with writing scribbled on the walls and very little mist. The writing is hard to read, as if the words were melting.

You turn around, with only that written on the walls.

A figure, different than the first, appears. Taller, broader build. It’s staring right at you. It seems to be holding something, and is in an attacking position.

You blink. You’ve moved from your original spot. The writing on the wall is clearer, the letters spelling out your name. You hear whispers, chanting your name. You turn to look at the figure. The figure has changed a third time.

It’s you. Hair, build, clothing and all. The figure has a flashlight, backpack, and something else... but you can’t quite make it out. You move towards the figure, you can see the pure terror in its eyes. You raise your right arm, brandishing a knife...

And swing.

You awaken in a moment, with a heavy pain in your side. You roll off of the bed, landing on the floor with a pained grunt. Raising yourself up, you check your side where you felt the ache.

But it’s completely fine. The pain has also vanished."

2. It would not be difficult for BP's to out-pace Moore's law. It's simply a matter of building bigger systems. For example, if they were to simply upgrade their CPU's once a year, they would be at pace with Moore's law. But if they upgrade their CPU's and increase the number of CPU's by 1%, they will outpace Moore's law by 1%."

"Эта излишняя бравада выглядит глупо, особенно когда некоторые придурки переходят границы разумного. Повторить то они может и смогут. Миллионы смертей повторить, например. Были и в советское время бухгалтера и прочий люд. Но тогда большая часть народа работали в полях, служили в советской армии, работали на заводах. Имели хорошую физическую подготовку, так как физкультуру в школе преподавал не ради того, чтобы было а для физического развития. И вот умнейший человек современности, герой бумажных волокит, гений 1с и калькулятора, попадает на фронт. Побежит 200 метров в обмундировании, услышит выстрел рядом и обгадит штаны. Великий подвиг. Война это не олимпиада, к войне никогда нельзя быть готовым. И даже самые опытные вояки сходили с ума на войне, и мелкие мальчишки верили подвиг. И не может быть никакой уверенности в том, что мы ""можем повторить"""

Yes. Without help you can't hope to win without friends. You cannot make friends by being a jerk. If Bernie tries to get the primary on progressive votes alone, he loses. The progressives don't have the numbers.

Bernie has to make inroads towards the party.

There isn't any bullying tactics. My tactics are to use the truth against an endless sea of hate and malice. They're to use good to be good.

Yes, you talk down to people and ignore the moderates.

&gt; Your reply seems way too patient for our current situation. Like Biden, it appears more suited to the 1990s. 

That is talking down to people. Which is a tactic used to belittle people and make whatever they have to say as something less than.

It shows distain for people who liked the 1980s. Out with the OLD ways, PROGRESSIVISM is the only answer!!! Moderation has failed us completely!!!

Is there where you learn the secret killing techniques as opposed to choking someone to death or breaking someone’s neck? I’m assuming traditional JJ has moved to rip out groins and hearts etc.

As opposed to chokes and neck cranks applies properly which is what is taught in Judo and BJJ."

"Normally, moneymaking depends on your ships, with bigger cargo slots or bigger weapons offering bigger money-making capabilities.

Currently, though, mining Void Opals is extremely lucrative, like way out of proportion compared to other methods.

Any time an AP melee champion is played bruiserish (Sylas, Ekko,Fizz) Riot quickly buffs their ratios immensely and guts their base damages so that building full ap is the only logical way to go. I will admit tank/bruiser Ekko were not healthy for the game but bruiser Sylas with IBG Spirit Visage and Zhonyas was interesting and they could have tried to balance around that instead of just buffing all his ratios."

"It's a 9 star mission, so if your hunter rank isn't high enough, it won't spawn the palicos that tell you to go to the Research base.

Once they do, you go there, get a cutscene, and get the mission.

As for the perfect run, you need to do both normal quest that you can see on the map, and the 2 hidden quest that you can't.   The two hidden quest are this.

1.  Look for graja'laka scribbles.  Once you find them, talk to the felyne researcher up in the north.  Go to the top of the tree, deal with the Graja'lakas, then go to the big vigor wasp and deal with the Graja'lakas there.  You're done with this part.

2.  Near the area you save a guy entangled in vines, there is a live pukie pukie entangled in vines a bit to the west.  Save it, and while you are fighting the Leshen, in the last phase (Zone 2) it will show up and try and help rather ineffectively.   Keep the dumb thing alive, and you get the best ending, aka an Attack Jewel.   Its a bit of a struggle to keep it alive, although if you are a good SnS user its a bit easier than the other weapons thanks to being better by a few notches due to being the story weapon.   Biggest thing to note is that you need to kill the jagras very fast or they will, as I said before, eat the Pukie pukie alive."

"&gt; All of the additional algorithms mentioned are weaker than AES.

Serpent is almost certainly stronger than AES.

Serpent was designed conservatively with an extra large security margin. Rijndael was chosen over it primarily due to better hardware performance, with its small-ish security margin accepted as an intentional trade-off.

That being said, you're right that nesting AES candidates is kind of silly and authentication is more important than any of the other considerations."

"Face the door of the tent “slightly”, downhill. By slightly, I mean like 1-3 degrees of incline, which won’t matter much for the small size of an average 12’x12’ family tent. Since water flows downhill this will prevent the water from entering through the door.

Dig a 2” deep by 2” wide [trench around the perimeter of your tent and dig a similar sized trench leading away from  one of the front corners of your tent](https://f0d3702a-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/10thmountiandivlhdg/training/tent-pitching/tent%20outlet.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7cqp9F9U0ZT4zDPJgdzZk7gi7V4rjWnz9lzyNxO4Gb_bpwpkUc-Qr62RwTUxd-QSICq1CFGtwDmOK3osTH_HLzHFsHdogaDU7d4_K2wKdtn-sMTFIBvFb_Niure0r8LlpQggR89lYOyO5U76LWDQjrbrPUELDKDL_uGolOjoNQZmALxeVN0AcgP4-AMi9V4w4WbY7tY6gIGt4AfUKEmcEZOqgzhOfSCZ83UUXpa_r7arj7W2Kez6kdbPAXjAF1oxcaWkQAcs&amp;attredirects=0) (preferably “slightly”, downhill). This will trap and carry away most rainwater... more rain calls for a larger trench, just don’t twist your ankle in it. 

Place a plastic sheet on the ground then place your tent on top of it to create a waterproof/resistant barrier between the wet ground and the bottom of your tent. Most tarps are not waterproof and tend to allow water to soak through. 

Also, buy some camping seam sealer to brush/roll onto the stitching seams in your tents construction, some use a brush others use a roller ball like a glue stick. Seam sealer is basically liquified silicone. You can get it for like $5 from [walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Coleman-2-oz-Waterproof-Seam-Sealer/13848651) or [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/slp/tent-seam-sealer/fpwm4hswokn88j8). Every Spring or summer you should re-apply to ensure a proper seal/water barrier.

Buy a can of camping silicone spray to spray on the outside of your tent to prevent water from leaking through the walls of the tent. You can get this for around $7-10 from [walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/KIWI-Camp-Dry-Heavy-Duty-Water-Repellant-10-5-oz/140567508?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;wl13=2250&amp;adid=22222222228055177294&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl2=m&amp;wl3=156485554278&amp;wl4=pla-270640867132&amp;wl5=9015720&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=140567508&amp;wl13=2250&amp;veh=sem&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl7_s9tmZ4gIVso1bCh372wlQEAkYCiABEgIXvPD_BwE) or [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Kiwi-Camp-Heavy-Water-Repellent/dp/B01LWIT5Z6/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?keywords=silicone+spray+waterproofing&amp;qid=1557791728&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=silicone+spray&amp;sr=8-3) and you can use it on your boots or other clothing items.

"This doesn't speak very highly of men, does it? ""We don't have the capacity to make decisions ourselves. We are told to act, and we act.""

Malicious intent is a worse crime than violent actions?

Edit: I can only post once every 9 minutes, because of all the downvotes I get posting here, and also Monday during work until 5pm is really the only time I spend all day online making reddit comments, so I'm probably done here. 

But with regards to your reply below: literally what else can someone take away from your claims?

Full story: Man kills innocent victim after woman makes false accusation of sexual assault.

MRAs: Stupid feminists will say BuT iT'S thE MaN'S FauLT

Me: But isn't that... uh... perfectly reasonable for feminists to say? Why wouldn't they say that?

You: Because the man was duped. The girl was malicious. 

(You did a ninja edit, by the way-- you've done several ninja edits and actual edits after posting-- and added the last 2 lines: Because the man will face punishment, the girl will receive none, and the second line which you quoted and said 'dear god'.)

You mock me as if I'm putting words in your mouth, but you and the other MRAs can't get over how some RIDICULOUS, EVIL FEMINIST might read this situation and focus on the male who murdered someone instead of the woman who is, at most, 15% responsible... 

But if your argument isn't that her malicious intent in lying about sexual assault is worse than the brother tackling the man, then what is your explanation for mocking this (presumed) feminist response?"

"Here's a basic primer for thermo without considering work (which is a good way to start):

* There are lots of types of energy, of which the two most relevant to chemistry are typically chemical potential energy and heat. Reactions can convert higher energy bonds into lower energy bonds, and the extra comes out as heat. They can also convert lower energy bonds into higher energy bonds, but then you have to put that extra energy into the reaction in the form of heat. This is what ΔH tells you--whether you get energy out, or have to put energy in, and how much. ΔH is a standardized number--per mole of reaction. So if something is ΔH = 40 kJ/mol, then if you do two moles of reaction, you'll have to put 80 kJ into it (in because it's positive).

* q is just the symbol for an amount of heat that goes in or out of something, typically measured in Joules. There are two basic types of q: objects and reactions. For a reaction, the q comes from the ΔH as described above (q = ΔH*n). 

* However, for an object (like a hot chunk of lead, or the solution that a reaction takes place in), there are three factors that go into q: the amount of stuff you have, how it responds to heat, and how much the temperature changes. So for an object, q = mcΔT or q= ncΔT depending on whether you're measuring amounts in grams or moles. The v and the p are just about whether you're keeping pressure of volume constant. So if I want to heat up 100 g of water (c=4.18 J/g*deg) by 20 oC, I'll need to put in q = 100*4.18*20 = 8360 J. If it cooled down 20 oC, I would instead get q = -8360 J because it's losing heat.

* So how do you solve problems? The first thing is to look at whether the question is about one thing or two. If the question is about one thing and that thing is a reaction, then q = ΔH*n and you just plug in what you have and solve. If it's about an object, q= mcΔT or ncΔT, and again, plug in and solve.

* If there are two things--a transfer of heat from one thing to another--then you use the fact that energy can't be created or destroyed. So, for example, I do a reaction and it heats up some water.  The reaction will have a negative q value, and the water must have an equal and opposite q value:  q reaction + q water = 0. Now I substitute ΔH*n for the reaction and mcΔT (or ncΔT) for the water, plug in whatever values I have, and solve for the one I'm missing.

Again, all of this is not considering work, which becomes relevant if you move some stuff (like push a piston)."

"S3E2, when Hange is interrogating Sannes, he mentions killing ""that teacher too smart for his own good,"" along with a picture of Sannes about to kill Erwin's dad. We didn't know who it was until the next episode though."
"For one, M Sader has more mechanics to worry about to achieve maximum buffing power (when should you use Ascension? Very important as it can make the difference of 1000 or more stats), and you'd be surprised at how many people don't even know how to use Jupiter when it's not hard to. You also have to constantly keep Ascension'd buffs powered up by using Divine Flash on teammates to refresh buff duration as you don't want to overwrite Ascension powered buffs with default ones, and he has less powerful healing on-demand compared to F Sader so he has a harder time keeping his teammates alive (but Fountain of Life is better over a long period of fighting, and I'd argue this is a harder skill to use than Seraph's resurrection).  
  
On top of this, if a teammate dies while under a Saint, it is significantly more punishing as the Saint is forced to rebuff without Ascension thus reducing the stats of the entire party across the board by a few thousands if the previous buff is Ascension powered.  
  
By comparison the Seraph is much simpler to play, there's not much else she can really do to optimize gameplay compared to how different a good Saint player is compared to a bad one.  
  
Edit: downvoted for speaking the truth? lol"

"Yes, yes, and yes.  My 2500k had a corsair 750w power supply after the rosewill I had started giving me issues.  I went from 5.0ghz easily with 1.4isb volts to needing about 1.42 to be stable.   The rosewill was a damn good power supply when I bought it.  Maybe not top tier, however nothing changes with it.  Started getting wierd errors on graphics card and finally found that the 600w power supply had come to be throwing lower voltages through the 12v rails.  Before anything bad happened I pulled it out and replaced it with a medium range corsair, cx I believe.   Ever since, that machine hadn't held 4.5ghz stable at a - 02 offset voltage.  I had to run 00 and it would reach 1.35v off and on which never happened before the switch.

I'm not saying every power supply is good or bad, but the corsair I bought to replace it obviously changed something in the power delivery."

Having now done this job twice I have some advice. Get a set of the replacement plastic Chrysler clips for the ends of the lines, reusing your old ones is a bad idea. Start hitting where the lines go into the radiator with penetrating fluid now because they can be an absolute bitch to get out in one piece. 

When you install the new lines, make sure they’re oriented correctly and have enough clearance. Replacement lines are often bent slightly different from stock and can make contact with the crank. Good luck!"

"Point made but don't you think that jumping from statistics to uni-dimensional conclusions goes a bit too far? I can understand a word of caution. What I can't understand is why we deify sexual exclusivity and/or long-lasting marriages as the source of all happiness. Quantity doesn't equate with quality or success for that matter - and this goes for both directions of the spectrum not just one of them.

We've all seen people being married their whole life and they are so devastated by the fact that they are forcing themselves into it that I just can't even stand looking at such cases anymore. I feel as if there's a noose being tightened around my neck when I am around such lots. I am not kidding. It's appalling. It's a nightmare."

"So far fasting 48 hours + eating lean meats made in my sous vide has allowed me to loose 100lbs in only a matter of 3 months.  I'm not strictly carnivore as I eat fruits and candy on occasion.

I'm not sure if this would help.  But I hope it does. Good luck!

"&gt;“You have to hand it to the GOP for achieving the near-impossible,” Hickenlooper said in early May. “Just years after the collapse of the Soviet Union…who would have imagined the Koch brothers and Donald Trump could help resuscitate the discredited ideas of Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin?”

&gt;Of course, Hickenlooper went on to say, he wasn’t trying to cast aspersions on Sanders as a human being by comparing him to Stalin, who murdered 20 million people. “Do I respect him?” Hickenlooper said. “Absolutely. Do I respect his supporters? Absolutely.” However, he said, he thinks Sanders is wrongly “demonizing the private sector” with ideas that will “hurt working people.”

&gt;The s-word has become such a political hot button that it’s caused even candidates whose platforms are similar to Sanders’ to make public disavowals. Longtime campaign-press pack leader John Heilemann, in an interview with Elizabeth Warren, claimed Hickenlooper was “afraid” to call himself a capitalist in the current environment, and confronted the Massachusetts senator by daring her to answer: Are you a capitalist?

&gt;&gt; “Yes,” she said, adding later: “I believe in markets.”

&gt;Luntz, Kurtz, Hickenlooper and Heilemann are all indulging in an old PR trick, one designed to reduce the political landscape to a stark (and fictitious) binary choice: One can either be a God-fearing, cheeseburger-loving American, or a Marxist, with nothing in between.

&gt;The Luntz poll question was framed as an either/or deal: Would you “rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one”? Hickenlooper was suggesting the choice is between capitalism and Stalinism. Heilemann is pushing a litmus test for candidates: capitalist or non-capitalist. All of this is designed to push the idea that a vote for Sanders (or for the kinds of policies he favors) is a vote to overthrow free enterprise.

&gt;The irony of all of this is that Sanders, who is painted as a sort of extremist menace and El Coco-style monster from whom we should hide the children, would have been considered a tepid Republican back in the Fifties, when the original red scare was at its peak.

&gt;When Dwight Eisenhower was president, ideas like state-subsidized mortgages, government-aided tuition, and socialized medicine were considered relatively mainstream. The top tax bracket was 91 percent, and though very few people actually paid that rate, some did — there were 10,000 taxpayers in 1958 who paid 81 percent or higher.

&gt;This is not to say tax rates that high would make sense today. But there’s a gigantic gap between advocating for free college tuition and single-payer health care and Stalin.

&gt;Sanders does pitch himself as a revolutionary (see On the Campaign Trail With Bernie Sanders 2.0). His use of the term, however, is less reality than a dark satirical commentary, speaking to how insanely far modern America has drifted in the direction of a laissez-faire free-for-all. There has not been a true labor candidate as a viable presence in a presidential race in modern American history: They’ve all been backed by big money.

&gt;National policy across the board is dominated by business. Politicians drenched in donations from Boeing, Raytheon, Northrup Grumman and Lockheed-Martin decide levels of military spending. On the banking and financial services committees, it’s Wall Street money that rules. The Ag committees are ruled by frankenfood and tobacco firms.

&gt;The likes of Kurtz and Luntz want to blame the media for changing attitudes, but the real issue is that the corporate cash that has dominated politics for decades almost exclusively pushed employer interests, ignoring all else — and voters have started, belatedly, to notice.

&gt;While big companies like Amazon systematically avoid taxes (literally to the point of paying nothing in many cases) most ordinary people are paying every penny of their individual tax obligations and not getting a lot in return.

&gt;What politicians like Sanders and Warren represent isn’t Marxism, but an introduction to what politics might look like if you removed money from the policymaking equation.

&gt;Most people would rather have affordable health and day care than battleships, they want to be able to go to college without being in debt until death, and they want better schools and more job security.

&gt;If policies like these were decided by up-and-down plebiscite, without the advocacy of corporate-sponsored politicians and media outlets that would lose fortunes in ad dollars if elections were publicly-funded, there’s little question that people would ask for more than they’re getting now."

I am all for seeing females in esports. They shouldn’t add females to events because they are females. It doesn’t do good to anyone.

There are people more worthy of playing there. They are more worthy not because they are males, straight, white, non-Australian or whatever, they are more worthy because they play better and work harder. By demonstratively adding someone over them just because of their sex, gender, nationality, race or whatever you spit in their face. It is called sexism, racism and further down the list.

You don’t help female representation by adding subpar players only because of their sex either. The “best” thing you will get is a player everyone vocally knows is there only because of it, hurting the image of women in esports. The “worst” - team vaeviktis. Women are not worse than men here, it is not boxing. Let them be.

Have you ever heard of sonicfox? He is a black gay furry. Nobody gives a fuck about that and you know why? Because he is one of the best players in fgc and deserves his place on the pedestal. This is how inclusivity in esports should look like - a great player showing his great skill. Not screwing good players because others have more twitch followers or other skin color or whatever.

But hey, maybe magic is not meant to be a real esport-just a silly show. That would be sad."
"Are you forgetting the fact she helped save the North and the entire North still hates her regardless and chooses Jon as leader, even though she is supposed to be Queen?

Shes lost faith and went mad because her claim to the throne is not only possibly challenged, but because everyone has shown her so far, they don't side with her.   
She started burning people alive in season 1. Justifiably at first, and then as it goes on, she let people get away with less and less to the point she burnt soldiers alive, purely for not following her when she could have easily shown mercy and won them over that way.   
She lost a follower because she didn't show mercy. The people she burned, were the family of the man that saved Jorah.   
Spiral into season 8, shes given less and less. Her best friends head was lobbed off. Her dragon shot and killed.   
and to her knowledge, no one in Westeros likes her, shown by the fact the Northmen only follow Jon. Not her.   


She was built up to be this hero that ultimately was never meant to be. Her story and change of character makes sense. It's all there."

I'm dreading the day that auto-updating gets enabled on production software -- I can just feel it coming.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't speak to Revit, but I can to Civil3D. There are quite a few factors that go into a decision to upgrade:

*  The biggest one by far is our clients. My main client requires us to be on the latest ""stable"" version of Civil3D (which also means Revit for the vertical) which is generally acknowledged to be around the first service pack of the version. We like to skip the odd numbered releases and we can usually negotiate that, but not always. I have at least one 2017 project floating around despite everything else being 2016 and 2018.
* Lately, newer versions have meant more stability which is huge for a program that used to struggle to do what vanilla AutoCAD did 15 years earlier. This alone isn't enough of a reason. If we know why things crash we can work or brute force our way around it. Failures that work constantly are fine, unpredictable and silent ones (like the miscalculation of some volumes in 2015/2016) are showstoppers.
* The latest versions have been packing in a ton of great new features that aid us in design every day and become un-editable in older versions (even ones with the same save file format - this is even becoming a problem from service pack to service pack). However, some of the additions to corridors and profiles have saved me literal weeks of design time. There are a few more (especially data shortcuts for sections) in 2020 that I can see bringing in even more savings (and Dynamo, if I ever spend the time to learn it, could be literally game-changing for our process).
* Support ends after 3 years. It can be that simple - IT doesn't want risks and users want problems solved when they inevitably have them.
* All the other new-fangled technologies in the industry get updated so often that they become incompatible with everything constantly. So while you may be able to hold some stuff down (can you imagine if Google actually *removed* the Google Earth Pro client from distribution!) some things need to be updated to advance with the rest of the world. I hate this one so much, but it is where we are."

I clearly addressed this.

&gt; But the LCOE analysis completely accounts for that difference. It means you can finance the solar and from day one pay less than you did on electricity. 

There isn't an additional hidden opportunity cost that isn't accounted for in the discount rate. I don't know if you really get what goes into an LCOE analysis."

"&gt; The writers responsibility is not to gender politics, but to create a good show

I don’t actually really disagree with you here, which is why one of the main things I said was that I wish they had left out the gender commentary stuff altogether.

You’re right, you didn’t specify gender, I just felt it was a jumping off point for an interesting discussion, especially because it is a trope that applies much much more heavily toward women even tho people like Ted Buddy certainly exist. 

And that is just a bummer for me. And it lessens my enjoyment of it. This stuff is all subjective, but not caring about identity politics at all doesn’t make you superior or my opinion invalid. It worked for you. It didn’t for me. I was distracted by watching a woman whose lived experiences with sexism often mirrored mine until it turned out they were all fair criticisms and she was a maniac for reasons that were not really emotionally resonant for me. And that just sucked. Idk what else to tell you. If people hadn’t been so sexist toward her last episode it probably wouldn’t have bothered me so much. Or if the show had actually done anything to convince me Jon would be a better leader, but when I look at him I see a man totally incapable of ruling that everyone keeps lifting up as the hero of the story."

Just space down and keep going, even if you do start over. Then when you have plenty for the assignment, edit it all at once, would be my advice.   


Also, if you are writing it, and have thought about it, even slightly, of course it makes sense. You have many years under your belt of consuming narrative, right? You know how to write a story, deep down. Try to silence that naysayer in your head. (Most of us have that naysayer in our head--even published authors, who worry ""it doesn't make sense."") Ignore that guy :D"

But it’s fair to say that labour and conservatives will be slaughtered.

"Not essential, but if you have the budget for it, it's a convenience I consider worth it.

I hope you're ready for driving here as well. Winter tires aren't an absolute necessity, but if you've got the storage space, they are a good extra piece of insurance when things get bad here and you *have* to drive somewhere. If you decide not to get them, make sure your all-seasons are in good condition before it starts snowing.

If you're coming from Texas, you may have used a heavier oil in your car, so just make sure to get an oil change before winter. The dealership will probably put in appropriate oil for your car and the climate, but you can confirm that by checking your owner's manual.

If your battery is around 5 years old, consider replacing it. If your car is over 100,000 miles, I'd consider replacing the alternator too as preventative maintenance. Replacing a battery but charging it with a bad alternator will lead to no-starts and eventually premature failure of the battery."

I hope your parents either aren’t LDS or that they support you. My parents on the other hand do not. My mom told my brother and I that we are bad people. She said she loves us but we will regret. She then went on to tell me my wife will be taken away from me after I die. My father in law did much worse. He told me I was in track to get a divorce and would be happy about it. These are otherwise good loving people.  A cult shaped them to hate things that they should love. This isn’t uncommon. The people in the church... I love them. They CAN be nice, like anyone. They CAN be hateful, like anyone. But the church is instrument of general lies and bigotry. The church is not overall good. I personally hate the church. It’s ripping my own family apart most of the time. So I might have vitriol now and then to let out. So I do it here, where a comforting ear will listen and say they love me or support me, because the church won’t, and now neither will my dear mom and dad, and sometimes my precious wife too. Sorry for the long one. But that’s why I rail against it. It took my loved ones a step further from me."

New Zealand does have Prime Video.  This is specifically the new Picard show that is on Prime, the other series are currently staying on Netflix.

&gt;Don't mistake ownership with official status. Reddit owns the page on  which we have that discussion. It is not responsible for the content of  that page, except ensuring we don't use such pages to plan the nuking of  NY. Same with CKII wiki - PDX disclaims responsibilty for it's content,  and de-facto 99% of wiki's content is provided not by PDX employees.

I'm surprised you are actually going to try to argue that. Let's pull up the [About Wiki page](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/Central:About) shall well?

&amp;#x200B;

First name on the list is Meneth and if you click his name this is what you get.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Magne ""Meneth"" Skjæran** is the creator of the [Paradox Wikis](https://paradoxwikis.com/).  Paradox Interactive in 2014 bought the wikis from him and hired him to  continue administrating them. As of 2019, Magne no longer administrates  the Paradox Wikis, focusing instead on his role as a programmer at [Paradox Development Studio](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/Paradox).  
&gt;  
&gt;Magne has worked on [Crusader Kings II](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Crusader_Kings_II_Wiki), and is a former CK2 modder. He's the creator of [Project Balance](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Project_Balance) and co-founder of the [Historical Immersion Project](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Historical_Immersion_Project). He's contributed to various other projects.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh look it says that Pdox owns the wikis now. They are official. Yes, I'm laughing my butt off at you.

&amp;#x200B;

Next name on the list is Badgr who is also a Pdox employee. Let's delve into the timeline for the wikis shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

* 2014-10-17 - Negotiations for the takeover of the Paradox Wikis and  hiring of Magne are finalized. The wikis soon after become the property  of Paradox, with Magne hired to continue administrating them
* 2014-11-18 - [The takeover is officially announced](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/Announcing-the-launch-of-the-Offical-Paradox-Wiki-Service.817542)
* 2014-12-05 - The [Europa Universalis: Rome Wiki](https://eurome.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis:_Rome_Wiki) is created and announced [two months later](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/EU-Rome-Wiki-relaunched.833607)
* 2015-07-31 - The [Stellaris Wiki](http://stellariswiki.com/Stellaris_Wiki) is created and announced [12 days later](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/stellaris-wiki.875979/)
* 2015-09-02 - The Paradox Wikis have their [account system merged](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/paradox-forums-and-paradox-wikis-have-merged.880002/) with the Paradox Forums

&amp;#x200B;

In 2014, Pdox announced that they were taking over of the wikis and it says that it is their property. Pdox created EU:Rome and Stellaris wiki. The wikis account system is merged with the Paradox Forums. That's official. \*Turns blue in the face and falls off his chair laughing at you.\*"

"oh look, there's my tuition!"
"Thanks for responding. I think a lot of what you've said makes sense.

&gt;I think sometimes people don't realize just how many YouTube series and podcasts and blogs are out there, and how many of them are expecting a relationship of ""all I have to do is post, and you give me clicks""

I think a lot of them are expecting that kind of a relationship. If that's not a relationship that helps the subreddit, whatever solution you come up with should do a good job of communicating what a healthy creator/subreddit relationship looks like. It doesn't sound like the solution in place right now is healthy for either side, because the sub has a lack of quality content and the creators don't feel welcome here.

I have no issues at all with you going through my post history or anything you've written in this reply. I'm trying to offer my perspective because I want to post here and I want it to be a good place for other people to post as well.

Before we proceed, though, this comment really stuck out to me:

&gt;So I'm gonna be honest: that last time around, we saw you not interacting much aside from a regularly-scheduled ""here's this week's episode"" complete with the stereotypical ""don't forget to like and subscribe"" and pile of social-media links, after having previously been a much more engaged member of the subreddit. And we called it like we saw it.

As someone who used to exclusively comment on content here and moved on to creating content that I almost exclusively post here, does that make me less engaged with the community? I think part of what I'm struggling with is that I feel like I'm a lot *more* engaged with the community now than when I posted those things about MMA draft.

That is why I take issue with the ""you are a spammer"" messaging. When I look at someone who simply grabs the most popular articles from whatever website and reposts them here, I see *that* as being a lot closer to spamming than what I do.

For reference, here's what my interaction with a /r/edh mod on Nov 1, 2018 looked like:

------------------------------

**Mod:** Hey chef

**Me:** Hey, what's up?

**Mod:** Just as a heads up, we're beginning to be moderately stricter on the bodies of content posts in the /r/edh subreddit. The posts you've made are fine, so you don't have to worry about any content being taken down. Going forward, the general guideline for content post bodies is that self-promotional parts, such as social media links, Patreon, or similar topics, should make up less than half of a post's body. This is more of a formalization of the already existing rule to ""discuss your articles"".

**Me:** Oh, yeah that's clean.

**Mod:** Just for example, this could be little blurbs under each of the deck links about what the decks do, discussion about certain situations in the game, or just generally inspiring a good attraction to the reddit post. Our philosophy is that we want to be ""symbiotic"" with content creators, so that members of the subreddit are encouraged to check out the content , but also subscribers of the content are encouraged to check out the subreddit. Otherwise, keep up the good work! The series posts for The Spike Feeders has been wildly popular, and they've been an excellent source of new content. Thank you!

**Me:** For sure, man. Not a problem. I really appreciate the explanation, by the way. I had a bit of a run-in with the mods on /r/magictcg and I'm done posting there now.

**Mod:** Ah, that's rough.

**Me:** This is much more helpful.

**Mod:** Yeah, this all came about because we had some people who were looking to post content on the subreddit, and wanted to know about the posting guidelines. We came up with the ""at least half of the body should be discussing the content and not the creators"". But yeah, keep up the good work!

**Me:** Yeah that's totally understandable. Do you mind if I run the next post by you before we post?

**Mod:** Of course! Feel free if you're ever unsure.

**Me:** K sweet. And yeah if anything else comes up just shoot me a message.

**Me:** [Screenshot of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/9vaqky/the_spike_feeders_s1e7_greatness_at_one_and_a/)

**Mod:** That looks perfect

**Me:** Awesome! I'll probably toss in time stamps to be clear about the actual plays I'm talking about, and Jan still has to fill in his rationale, but we will probably keep this format going forward.

---------------------------------

Now contrast this with my interaction with your moderator:

**Me:** Good morning! I noticed that my thread was recently deleted. Can you please let me know if I was violating any of the sub's rules? I would definitely like to avoid doing so in the future. Thanks, Jim.

-3 days later-

**Mod:** You're basically spamming and breaking rule 9. Stop.

**Me:** Okay. Thanks for the response.

---------------------------------

I realize that you're not going to provide personalized responses to each new content creator that starts self-promoting, but the difference between ""do not do this"" and ""you could do this in a way that accomplishes both our goals"" is pretty drastic and can be achieved really easily with form letter responses."

"Hmmmm some people have asked me this recently so I do have a decent idea of what works when I’m looking. There’s obviously the androgynous and masculine styles, backwards caps, baggy clothes, etc etc that’s associated with the “dykey” type of lesbians, and the less meme-y fashion choices like thumb rings and septums

but for me I can usually suss out the more stealth ones in little mannerisms. There’s a certain walk that’s hard to explain, a kinda casual leaning back almost manly way of walking that I’ve noticed even in some pretty feminine queer girls. Confident in taking up space, usually big top energy. Then there’s actually meeting wlw and the way they greet me is different than straight girls. There’s normally an up and down, almost hungry look, not usually creepy but noticeable. A lot more staring at my lips. Or if I see them doing the same to other girls. Little excuses to touch other girls’ arms and hands. Consistently staring at lady butts haha

Anyway. Wow. I love lesbians"

"Was thinking of dropping my car off and taking the ferry from Prince Rupert then hitchhiking around! That'd cost me about $80 round trip to get there. But I'd like to experience the culture and the wildlife. Lots of people go to Gwai Haanas for backcountry kayaking but that's typically expensive and requires either being dropped off or a 4 day minimum round trip, I saw a week rental quoted as ~$500 for a double kayak. So I was hoping someone might have some knowledge of trips not necessarily in the park or maybe ways to access the park on the cheap."

"You need a new residence.   Their bad financial behavior will eventually destroy you.     If you don't have friends you can move in with (offer to pay rent) look for someone who wants a roommate.   You have to get away from your parents.

In the short term you should open a new bank account at a different institution that your parents don't know about.   This:

&gt; My dad's account is overdrawn so he's using my own bank checking account. 

and this: 

&gt; They've already had me pull out a loan in my name for them

are both unacceptable.   Once you start cutting them off financially however, there is a good chance they will try to turn you out so you should definitely get living arrangements dealt with as you try to extricate yourself from their problems.  

You cannot afford to underwrite your parents financially or mentally.     What you must do will not be easy but you have no choice."

There are psychological reasons behind why game developers try to avoid such things.

 Like many other early mass-transit systems, the Underground started out  as a series of privately held rail lines built by different developers.  It wasn’t until American financier and transportation magnate Charles  Yerkes came on the scene that the consolidated system we know today came  into being. Yerkes, who had played a key role in developing Chicago’s  elevated railway system, popularly known as the “L,” created the  Underground Electric Railways Company of London in 1900, and eventually  took control of several existing lines in the city—fighting off a  challenge by another American businessman, J.P. Morgan, to unify  London’s mass transit."

That wasn’t my question though!
"So I used to work at a (corporately owned) branch of the same company. Typically the director doesn't spend much time with students at the tutoring center- if they are making good money. They spend most of their time either killing time in their office or meeting with parents. If they aren't making good money, then there's more of a chance for the director to be around the kids."
yes
How lightweight ? How cheap ? There are those foil emergency blankets / sleeping bags. They only cost a couple of dollars and can fit in your pocket. I would never use one but it is an option.

"I think that's the point. While I think there are legit reasons for homeschooling (e.g. you live in a remote area where all the school choices are terrible or non-existent), the majority of cases is that you want your kid to be ""pure"".

"Thanks for you concern but I'm not depressed. I was just stressed with the schedule I'd set for myself. I spent time alone and that seemed to have fixed it. It was just the mood. A long mood. Almost like a menstrual cycle mood even though I'm not a girl, which is weird since I don't have as much estrogen or any uterus. I'll get back to normal tomorrow. I shouldn't push myself."
Is there a Pikachu movie coming out or something? suddenly I'm seeing posts all over the place regarding this character
"I want Wolverine back as much as the next guy, but it's hard for me to imagine a reality in which we're able to sign him along with a couple marquee pieces this offseason. Even if we dont follow-up on the FA moves we've been vying for, realistically what amount would you be happy signing a 31 yo Patrick Beverley coming off the healthiest season of his career for? Love him, but don't see any reason to expect him back unless he takes a ridiculous discount. Which, as a fan, I sincerely hope he doesn't take."
"It’s not a dirty trick because it doesn’t fucking work lol, your definition of god here is laughable."

"If I tried homeschooling a child and after 6 months to a year of committing to it I found that I entirely failed to teach age-appropriate basics, the mature thing to do would be to admit I'm not cut out for it, and reach out to people that are actually competent in teaching kids. Teachers, tutors, anyone who doesn't just sit there and go 'whew, education sure is tricky' and leaves it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's important to give yourself the space to struggle with things, to be patient and forgiving with your flaws, but at the end of the line, results also do matter, and as an adult, you're responsible for what happens when you let a situation spiral out of control. If you just 'can't manage', get help. It's okay to need help to get something done, that's normal. It's not okay to stand there as a situation gets worse and worse and wait for a miracle."

"\&gt;if a woman wants to cheat lack of sex isn't gonna be the reason 99 percent of the time. It's lack of respect to her man.

this is true but only because it coincidentally happens to be for this reason. women cheat on their mates overseas in the military very often. usually men don't deny sex so it won't be because of lack of sex"
"No no, dude as long as you put the blank shield on the edge it's totally safe. My father did that all the time in some of the films he did. As long as you act professionally, it's really not dangerous, and easily the most realistic."

Depends.  If you can enslave them and get them to steal you neighbors shit...pretty cool.  If they’re sealing your shit and trying to enslave you...exponentially less cool.
"Your ""past me's"" were in a cult so you need to cut them some slack. :)"
If you cant be convinced dont complain when people become frustrated and insult you. People respect others with open minds a whole lot more then those who are here just to state their unwavering belief and be done with it.

I know exactly what Avatar brought to 3D, and that is the only reason I’m excited to see a sequel. It has nothing to do The the story of Avatar and everything to do with the technology used to shoot that movie. Every bit of Avatar was shot in 3D, using techniques never before seen. James Cameron could make a movie about anything and I’m going to go see it for the technological advancement alone, if he is pioneering a new way to shoot movies. 

Truth is that not many movies have been shot like Avatar since then. I did the 3D thing for a while, but after Avatar, nothing really compared and was just sort of a gimmick."

"This is just the painful truth. Say what you want about Farrakhan and the NOI. Think about the brothers and sisters you've met throughout your life who are black Muslims. They are always respectable, educated, and married. Hell, Malcolm was a pimp, thief, thug and POS before the NOI. Look what they turned him into. Farrakhan has both that calming and motivational effect. In fact all the major black Muslim ministers (Dr. Khalid, Malcolm, Farrakhan) are/were inspirational, while the black Christian ministers buy yachts and shit after milking black people for their last pennies. Wonder how that reality came to fruition like that...

You're right. Tariq is a creative, respectable brother. But he's not a firebrand like Farrakhan and I personally don't think he wants that. I notice you kind of glossed over the Umar Johnson reference. Any comment there? All I know is that if I had a few million sitting around, I'd buy land, weapons, invite all black soldiers to live and build there for free, and just channel everything that Farrakhan, Malcolm, Huey, Assata, etc. have tried to teach us over the decades. Divest of materialism until we learn to love each other again. Travel and the spread the word directly. Its a dream, but I'm allowed to dream.

Do you want to know why people don't take things like this seriously? I think it has to do with environmentalists personalities over playing their cards early on and making billions of dollars off people and a lot of the outlandish claims that haven't come true. The fact is is  certain people damaged the trust.   


Secondly Its hard for human beings to realize that this is a long term issue as it doesn't effect them now or even for decades.

Here is a long term chart of C02 levels on the planet.

This is also a interesting read. AS CO2 levels rise the earth is becoming more green.

"" The last time the planet had a concentration of 300 to 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere was during the mid-Pliocene, 3 million years ago — recently enough for the planet to be not radically different than it is today. Back then, temperatures were 2 degrees C to 3 degrees C (3.6 to 5.4**°**F) above pre-industrial temperatures (though more than 10 degrees C hotter in the Arctic), and sea levels were at least 15-25 meters higher. Forest grew in the Canadian North and grasslands abounded worldwide; the Sahara was probably covered in vegetation. *Homo habilis* (aka “handy man”), the first species in the *Homo* line and probably the first stone-tool users, ""

 “The vast majority of that \[greenhouse\] warming is contributed by water vapor. Together with cloud, it accounts for 98% of the greenhouse effect.” pg. 249   


Here is another interesting read about a ice age when C02 levels were 12-15 times higher than current

\- Florida and California well be under water and their well be mass migration.

\- Our electrical systems well fail.

\- All our crops well die from the heat.

\- The Arctic well be completely melted and it'll be to hot for humans to live near the equator. (The polar bears well be extinct by 2014)"

"Keep in mind that this is assuming each champion has only one role. When a champion is in different lanes they generally keep the same strategy in terms of macro, and Vlad maintains the same strategies he'd employ in his best role (top).

So to break down the game plan for Vladimir, as a toplaner he has the potential to duel a huge part of the roster once he gets to 11 and has items. He's able to push people out of lane and make some really powerful turret dives, and so most of the time you'll be splitting in lane with TP. You can group up if you can't fight the enemy, but assuming you're a skilled Vlad player into most teamcomps you can 1v2 or even 1v3 in optimal scenarios at that point.

Also you're both safe and you have TP to join those fights anyway.

As for mid Vlad, you mostly have to just push and look for flanks, assuming you ran Ghost or Ignite instead of TP. You can easily get in the enemy's jungle if you know where 3 of the enemy team members are (again, the 1v2), and then show up behind the enemy backline because you have the tools to do so and stay safe because of Phase Rush/W and eventually Zhonya's."

The big end of the cone was down when I found it.

"We were going to try something similar, but we decided it was going to be too hard, or likely not work out how we wanted, so we gave that up.

"Yep, the novels are official. Especially these days. There’s a lot of cross-pollination and cooperation between a lot of authors and designers, and a lot of the time a project’s relevant details are in another novel rather than a codex, say. 

We don’t really regard any order of canonicity or officialness, these days. (And honestly, we rarely stuck to it when there were vague notions of one, years ago. It’s always been on an author by author, book by book basis. Name a novel or a codex and it will be the exception to at least one rule somewhere. It’s how the setting works.) 

 “It’s all true and none of it’s true” is the real stance."

"I'd like them more if they were a real, technical behind the scenes thing. How did they film this explosion, how many takes, did it take to get this shit right, what changes were made to the script before shooting this scene, etc. Instead it's just them going scene by scene and telling you how characters feel about other characters. We fucking know that, we just watched it."

"The thing is, measured aggression is easier to pull off against teams that make plenty of mistakes. And it's not like the better teams aren't taking measured aggression, its not sporadic crazy uncalculated plays that are making teams win, it's well calculated, well planned to the smallest detail plays that are making teams win. 

If you put me up against a silver team ofc I'll be happier to make aggressive plays because i know there will never be a punish. But when I'm forced to calculate every move can I still make aggressive plays and not get assblassted? That's where the difference between a good and great player lies."

"Living minimally has become an aesthetic choice for many. It looks great when you have beautiful solid wood floors, a brick-faced feature wall, and a modern kitchen, and a landlord that will let you hammer nails into the wall. 

My flat is old, which is reflected in the relative cheapness of the rent. The plastic is peeling from the chipboard countertops. The floor doesn't match anything. The blinds are stained. The window in the bedroom faces an alley so there isn't any light in there. The very very compact bathroom has some weird glitter lino fresh from the 00's. 

The only way to make this cheap pile of crap look like a home rather than a crack den was to fill it with furniture and decorations (which was simple since an apartment with storage space costs £££)."

"Its no so much that her decent into madness wasnt set up, its that there wasnt really a breaking point or a catalyst that caused her to snap. The battle was won but then she just gets crazy eyes &amp; starts burning the place to the ground. 

Even if she would have caught a glimpse of Jamie in the city that would have been enough to tell her that even Tyrion, her hand, betrayed her. At which point she snaps &amp; burns it all to the ground. I guess maybe her breaking point was the night before with Jon but i still feel like there should have been something in the moment that caused her to go full mad queen. Also if im not mistaken wasnt her fathers plan to blow up the city as a last ditch effort? Well Dany had won the battle for kings landing, then still burned it all anyway after her victory. It makes her even more mad than the mad king. 

Its not so much that im dissapointed with what happened to her character, i actually like the direction they are taking it. As a viewer I just would have liked to see something more definitive that you can point to and say ""that is what pushed her over the edge"""

"I mean, it depends on what you consider to be too big before you consider it a ""bulky box"".  If you want anything worth talking about, it's gonna be larger than a little EGO/510 pen.


I have an ArGo that is smaller than my (modern and not bulky) dual 18650 (e-juice) box mod.  It's small enough to almost call it ""tiny"" (*definitely* portable) and packs serious performance for what it is.  Though, it does cost a bit more than many portables...

Ditto for something like the Fury2.  I've never used one but people seem to love them, they're just about the same size as the ArGo.


You *could* use a a VapCap, they're as small as a little vape pen - but, you also need a heat source.  Gotta be honest, where I'm at (illegal and a suburb neighborhood) - I wouldn't want someone seeing me heating a VapCap.  They'd totally think it's a crackpipe or something, whereas you can't even tell my ArGo isn't a ""normal vape"".



Here's a post/pic of some portable vapes lined-up next to a Bic (name's are listed left-to-right):

https://www.imgrum.pw/media/1850981983221866379

That being said, for someone used to *HUGE* rips from a fully packed bong or something, the portables I've used won't provide that.  Then again, I don't know why you'd expect that in a portable setup anyway.  No one's out there carrying around 3' bongs when they're walking the dog (well, I'm sure someone is lol, but you get the point).  I'd say my ArGo is like a nice joint (that tastes 1,000x better) if I'm using it outdoors for a little sesh.

It's just a different experience than fully packing/clearing a Sherlock Bubbler in one/two hits.

Now, my E-Nano (plug-in Desktop vape)?  Hoo boy.  That thing *rips* if you want it to.  That little guy rivals the combusting experience for sure.  You want it to plow through water?  It'll do it.  You want to have a coughing fit?  No problemo."

"Look, if you have no ventilation in a car with no insulation and a car with insulation, you are correct. The insulated car will stay cool longer but eventually get just as hot. If you HAVE ventilation in a car with no insulation and a car with insulation, you need much less ventilation to keep the insulated car at ambient. And if it's really really hot, you may not be able to keep the non-insulater car at ambient short of using a high cfm fan.

"It’s not even for ratings. They’re spreading blood libel. Yes I mean the Nazi propaganda and no it’s not an exaggeration to say that, the difference is now it includes all “liberals” as well.  Just today they repeated the lie that “liberals” are literally murdering naturally born, fully gestated babies. That’s right, they suggested that there’s a widespread practice occurring all over America right now wherein mothers are carrying babies to term, giving birth to them in a hospital, and then the mother and doctor have a short discussion before killing a living, alert, baby.

The thing is, if anyone actually believes this, then violence is a rational response.  But of course, it isn’t.  If they named a single person they would be arrested for incitement and sued for libel, no brainer, but they get to avoid consequences because they just say it’s ALL “liberals.”  It’s extremely dangerous, and it’s obviously for something MUCH MUCH MORE sinister than “ratings” or “profit.”  It’s terrorism."

"Not really. He forgot his humanity more. It was a super odd character arc, especially relative to the popular sci-fi/fantasy of the time.  Urza was always enamored with technology and such but it wasn’t overt selfishness like we have had with the current walkers.

I will say that I’m so confused they haven’t used the body horror of Yawgmoth’s phyrexia more often. I feel like the thran novel and Gix were some of the first ideas to ever make me itchy."

"Well that’s that. No more wondering or worrying and no more “it’ll be better this time around”. She disprespected you, your kids, and everyone you both know. Her and Mr. WhistleBlower. You of course have to be polite though. Regardless of what the angry chumps on this post say, your kids need her and you of course, if you plan on raising good kids. They need both parents. Why? As kids grow older, they start to see their parents less as untouchable superheroes and more as human beings with weaknesses just like everyone else. At one point they’re gonna find out why you two split. They’re gonna see which of the two of you are the weaker one. It happens like that especially in a divorce. Who will give the best gifts, best advicd. Who takes them to the best dinners, parks, and movies. But as adults, those will just be good memories. You gotta get physically and mentally fit. You gotta work on yourself so you can work on your kids. I know we’re people, but the whole natural order of life is to breed a stronger generation. You really dont wanna be that sad father who lives alone and your kids force themselves to see just to make you feel like someone in the world loves you. Don’t go looking for another wife after the divorce. Focus on handling solitude. Spend time on the things you like. Think of it as this, it’s not what has happened to you in your life right now, it’s what you have been given. It’s not a tragedy, it’s an edge. An angle. You’ve gained perspective. A dose of numbness to your love life like a piece of armor. What she do? Ruin your marriage to be with someone. She gonna live her life like that? For a lover rather than a solid home and family? That’s what you’re left with. That’s what you got outta it. But she mighta also cheated for a reason. Maybe Mr.WB has thicker quads. Confident smile. Better dresser. Better jokes. Better sayings. You wanna be the same person to someone else that you’re wife already had?"

Murdering innocents is evil.  Being a politician doesn't make it less evil.
personally I don't see how you can say that when halfway throughout season 1 Korra willingly gives up Mako to go with Asami once we find out that asami's dad is an equalist. That's not selfish quality right there in terms of romantic relationships....and let's not forget the fact that at the end of season 2 she was mature enough to realize that mako and her didn't work and broke up with him or the fact that in season 3 episode 1 she apologized to Asami for everything that she's done... and also let's not forget the several times where she sacrificed herself in terms of the bigger picture for the world and others...
"Buy a new car. You’ll end up paying almost brand new on a second hand car, and yes 3 years old car is not that bad, but it is a hit or miss when buying 2nd hand car.

And the interest on a secondhand car is higher compared to new one."

"That's a childish way to interpret it, yes. 

Suppose a cop is detaining someone to conduct an investigation. Part of that detainment means handcuffing the suspect. If that suspect resists detainment and puts up a fight, should the cop just give up and let them go, because technically they're not under arrest? How would anything ever get done if someone could just resist and flee during an investigation? 

Law enforcement doesn't work that way in country on this planet."

*Discipline* is an entirely other thing, and is what I am trying to replace motivation with.

When you have discipline, you make the conscious decision within yourself to do what it is that YOU want to do, need to do, and you stick to it, even when you don't want to. You stick to it even when that twinge of pressure forms from anticipatory anxiety which then turns to procrastination.

She absolutely could have pulled off a mad queen arc, she’s been shit on way more than Dany. At least Dany had A LOT of victories along the way. Sansa has experienced way more loss and defeat. I know a lot of people hated the way she acted in the beginning of the season, but the Stark girls and the Hound are the only ones that stayed true to their character development."

"Shut up. This is the most arrogant question that gets tossed around on here and it makes my blood boil. ""Why IB?"" The answer is money. The answer is always money. Maybe its money and societal stature, but it's always money. Yes ""there are other easier ways to get rich"", but why the fuck aren't you doing that then? When it boils down to it, most people who are willing to slave away working 90+ hours a week are looking for wealth, social stature, and high income without the employment vulnerability of sales. No shame in that, but own it and stop trying to spin going into any form of finance (aside from FP&amp;A) as some holier than thou quest for knowledge or service."

"I would use Realbench + Blender. (if just mostly gaming, streaming, video rendering)

Because Blender has cpu **3D rendering** and it's used for animation, making video games, and more. 

Realbench stress test is just GIMP photo editiing, video rendering, luxmark(gpu), and multi-tasking on a loop, which is still great, just missing 3D rendering workloads.

Blender official benchmark can take a while if you run the full load though. Like 90 minutes.

"I don’t have martyr so I can’t help you there, she’s a def% char so it’s slightly different. 40khp and 171 speed is for dps and sup, counter champ is timed different. I run valk reflex and speed and def%. She’s only there for counter, martyr does better dmg but is also only there for def, counter and attack down. 

171 is to get in the max turns before the boss and to time so all chars get 2x autos on counter aoe. 

Again you really can’t look at hard cb numbers, you have attack down and def up so gearing damage may be more beneficial before the inevitable one shot but you need a high hop to survive his one one shots late game."
This happened to my boyfriend. I literally called to ask what the deductible was on his renter's insurance when someone broke into his house. We were debating whether it was worth it to file a claim. A year later MY insurance told me when I gave them his info to get a quote because we bought a house together and were purchasing homeowner's insurance.
"I was mostly satisfied with the LOST ending because the writers remained true to the characters at the core of the series. The best part of the show was always the characters, and the island mysteries were just window dressing. Sure, it was frustrating when it became clear that the writers had never intended for all the mysteries to really come together to make any cohesive big reveal, but the characters were there in the end. I felt emotionally invested in that finale, despite its severe shortcomings in many respects.

GoT is far worse than LOST, imo. They have forsaken the characters, so I am no longer remotely emotionally engaged in this travesty. This is moving into Dexter territory, only way more devastating, because Dexter was just a good TV show, whereas GoT has been a huge part of my pop culture identity for half my life. What D&amp;D are doing to this series is truly unforgivable."

“Other than that, stay strong. Some of the newer campers, they think being a counsellor means cooking a meal, being bossy, and cleaning.

"Problem is that they aren't asking for cats playing ping pong.  The problem is they want the error printed out in a way the user can understand and 'fix'.  But we just catch exceptions, add information from the function you are in then escape out and tack that message onto a message from the parent function.

So you end up with:

[Message for top level] [Message for child &lt;Name of api call with some data&gt;] [Message from the api itself &lt;redundant data&gt;] [Message from sub function] [Message from where the actual error occurred with data] [Unreadable nonsense from exception] [Stacktrace].

Devs need all that to track it down... users might need the message where the error happened, but even then it might not actually be useful for them.  Even if we make a system that says: Can't remove that because it is used (and then include where it is used... this is the main message they want simplified and expanded upon) the user just won't read it and will call to ask why they got an error."

"Subs scratch my itch, I could get high as fuck with a low tolerance or a few days being sick, prison was great with subs. But it feels more similar to me doing a low dose of heroin than something for maintence, not like literal low dose heroin, but it’s like I’m only not high because I can’t get high type of deals. Even after weeks on them, I’d shoot one and get a very mild feeling, and just gets me jonesing until I’m shooting subs to the point I’m puking for a good day. 

It is nice in the way it scratches the itch. Gets me warm like, puts some pep in the step but feels rather natural, almost like being a teenager and waking up early after a night of good sleep before my body was fucked. It’s not really potent enough to get much off of, and taking more just becomes counterproductive, it more just kills the good and brings more bad so it’s even more worth it to really limit my dosing and it’s got engrained in me to not be constantly chasing shit now.

I appreciate it though. I really don’t understand the hate people give it or the community, It’s an amazing tool, and all of us are all really on the same side when it comes down too it. Just so many assumptions, and misunderstandings, some lack of responsibility. I don’t think any sane person could read the science and at least not agree to the fact that it’s worth researching more, and certainly doesn’t deserve a schedule 1 nor everyone who uses it now to be kicked to the curb."

Dany showed signs of her madness in earlier seasons. Hanging the prisoner in Meereen, burning the Khals and the Tarlys alive. She's always been quick to punish. She went from city to city in Essos telling the slave masters to surrender or die. She'd been talked down from drastic action many times over the years, and now Tyrion did it one more time but after losing Rhaegal and Missandei she obviously hoped they wouldn't surrender because she really wanted the excuse to burn them all.

Jamie didn't change and change back, he was always the same guy. At least, throughout his evolution he always loved Cersei. In the end he tried to be a better man but couldn't stay away. That's good character writing.

Bran was as much of a waste of time as his namesake cereal, it's true. And the biggest disappointment of the season for me is the cost cutting on the CGI. Jon having to leave Ghost is lame as hell.

As for the writers not understand siege tactics, I'm very forgiving about that because I don't understand siege tactics either. That's one they definitely should have had some advice on, but it really makes no difference to 99% of the audience.

I'm also forgiving of time skips. They have to travel a lot without much content to show us, but that's a hell of a point about Cersei's baby bump. Could it all have happened in less than...what, five months? Probably not."

"I think this is a really arrogant way of looking at. We simply interact with strangers differently.

From your perspective, Americans must be “fake” in their friendliness, because compared to the always-logical, blunt and straightforward Dutch, that kind of behavior seems comical. It must be fake, right?

Now from my perspective, as an American living in Germany, my first thought upon arriving here was “Damn, this people are rude as fuck. Too important to just smile back at me as we pass each other on a nature path?”

Was I correct, though? No, absolutely not. I quickly came to realize that Germans aren’t “rude”. Americans aren’t “fake.” It’s simply a cultural difference, not some kind of character flaw. It only seems “fake” or “wrong” if you’re exclusively viewing it through your own cultural perspective, what’s normal or organic to *you.* What may be “straightforward and blunt” to you can seem rude and unnecessarily “edgy” to me, for lack of a better term. What seems friendly and normal to me appears “fake and forced” to you, y’know?

Really not trying to rag on you here, but Americans get called out for being arrogant and culturally obvious (and they often are when visiting Europe), and this is really just the same thing going in the opposite direction."

Daenerys is well-meaning, incompetent, and impulsive. Not having the small-folk voluntarily rally to her side in KL played perfectly into evoking a negative reaction from her savior complex.

"We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.

"Mic Todd was amazing, is amazing. His departure from Coheed hit me especially hard. I was headfirst in a heroin addiction and had convinced myself that it was only a problem because I wasn't in the right place in life to afford it easily.... Then there was Mic, a definite hero of mine, in one of the best bands in the world touring with Soundgarden, more heroes of mine, and yet he risked and lost it all for a couple fucking pills it crushed me in so many ways. Then there was Josh who had spent his time away and cleaned up, back with the band, smiling ear to ear every hit, that was hope for me. So I got clean, I can only hope that mic has found his way, and say that as an ex junkie I understand. To all the fans saying he didn't care... Opiates make you sick as hell, no way anyone going through withdrawals would feel capable of playing, in his mind he was saving the day by getting well and putting a show on for us.

This comes and goes and doesn't seem to affect my walking but I am worried about it because it's a new symptom. I had some falls last year and am really hoping it doesn't happen again.

As described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3089849/ruby-on-rails-submitting-an-array-in-a-form

Then in the model I'd make the name attribute be a serialized array. 

And finally I'd write a method on that model like ""to_comma_delimited_string"" to turn that array of names into a comma delimited string and call that whenever you need it.

Or alternatively, use the multiple true to submit the array of names. Then write a before_validation callback on the model that processes the array of names into a comma delimited string."

That is why this feels counterproductive to you 

&gt;So you have no evidence for this at all. Wow. This has turned into a complete waste of my time with nothing of real substance from you.

Wow. So first off, i gave my reasonings and ""evidence"" for my case, while acknowledging it doesn't definitively prove me right. Again, that is to make my case and further discussion. You claim to want everyone to think critically about news and issues today, so why is a discussion about the credibility of news sources ""worthless"" to you if nothing can be definitively proven right there? I think this shows how you are simply arguing rather than discussing."

"Again, these are my own personal views and I’m really not interested in debating a personal view; I was just responding to the original questions.

I know that Evan was a dead beat dad, this is why I said that I believe him to be a victim of Csa - he might of felt jealous of Mj, actress Carrie Fisher said something along the lines that he creeped her out when he spoke about the relationship Jordie had with Mj, and that he kept commenting that his son was extremely good looking (or attractive, one of these adjectives).

Michael didn’t see a problem with the kind of abuse he inflicted on these children. It is my belief - again, I must stress that my personal beliefs are not open for debate - that he thought that abuse is when the child is coerced into doing something he doesn’t want to do, ergo he wasn’t abusing anyone.

We can only speculate as to what Evan wanted - you’re entitled to your opinion, as I am to mine. I don’t think that he would go to a lawyer (he mentions it in the transcript; also, if you read the book that I posted, you’ll see that he suspected sexual relationships since the spooning incident in his home, and yes, to me it’s a reliable source), if he didn’t have something to lawyer up about. Stealing emotionally one’s son does not constitute motive for a going to a lawyer, suing, etc."

But a lot of people aren’t like that, and the great job’s and way to go’s spur them to create, maybe help push them past a creative block or spell of self-doubt. Everyone has a process."

"This one's not very bright. Sexually attractive figures are made that way to emphasize the power of the character involved.

Sexual power *is* a type of power: people who are physically attractive make the most money (on average), and have the best prospect of getting the mate of their choice (on average). So when you look at a picture of someone like Conan, you know that this person is, for lack of a better word, a winner.

That's why armor with exaggerated male features (like the codpieces mentioned here) was created. In addition to the various ceremonial muscle armors you can find throughout history. Because, while the primary function of armor is to defend, a *secondary* purpose that many armors have is to visually intimidate or awe an onlooker.

Whether that effect is through sculpted sexually appealing features or other awe inspiring additions, like the menpo of a Samurai armor, it is most certainly something that could be seen on a battlefield. Especially in a fantasy setting, where realism and spectacle often go hand in hand.

And *of course* the Conan character is targeted at a male audience, in that it's someone they recognize as being socially desirable: the shirtless barbarian archetype represents physical and sexual potency. And, no matter how authors like her try to disguise it, muscular, physically fit men *are* desired by most women.

Naturally, Conan and company are an over-exaggerated version of this look, much like the over-exaggerated female characters emphasize *their* sexual aspects. But make no mistake, the muscular look of men in fiction is directly related to the female gaze. https://i.imgur.com/mlbXTBo.jpg

Compare these other pictures of attractive individuals next to those with ""average"" attractiveness. There's a reason why the covers of romance novels aren't filled with men in the second picture. https://i.imgur.com/zEVpEsR.jpg 

In addition, his companion is *much* less likely to be the women that female readers want to imagine paired next to the guy on the original cover, and so you see very few women with her body type on those novels, too.

That's why superheroes, both male and female, are drawn with ""heroic proportions"" rather than in a more realistic fashion; they're unique over-the-top individuals who are both physically and sexually powerful. In other words: attractive.

It's visual shorthand for ""This is a badass person, capable of doing things that are beyond what you, the reader, can do"".

&gt;My daughter shouldn’t believe that bigger boobs or a smaller waist will give her more value as a person.

Too bad? They absolutely will. And the corresponding signals of physical attractiveness in a man will do the exact same thing for him. People respond more favorably to good-looking individuals. 

&gt;I’m raising a warrior, and when she holds aloft the severed head of her enemies, she’s not going to worry about being sexy enough.

If her ""warrior"" neglects that aspect of life, it's more likely other girls will be holding *her* severed head (metaphorically speaking). Same with any potential boy that the author might raise: if they look like a sack of potatoes, they'll experience less opportunity than their more appealing counterparts."

"Your rear derailer might allow for a larger cassette (maybe a 32t?), but you might also swap your inner chainring for a smaller one. Just have to make sure it's the same bolt pattern and BCD. Up front shifting will suffer, since the ramps/pins are designed for specific chainring combinations. 

Something to keep in mind is that the chain may not clear the chainstay if you're on the small ring and the small cogs, so avoid crosschaining.

The chain may also end up being too long for the rear derailer to take up slack when in these combinations, so you may want to remove some links. However, this may make the chain too short to handle the big/big combo. It's not fatal either way, just something to keep in mind when doing something outside of intended specifications."

Tati did this too- I was really annoyed in her video (in many ways but this was one lol) because it felt like she was on the one hand talking about the important subject of him using his influence and power to pressure people sexually but also mixing in her distaste for his crassness.

How long were you on amoxicillin and clarithromicyn? Also four different antibiotics seem a bit excessive, were you prescribed two at a time?

There is also growing research showing that humans evolved with H.pylori, and 100% of people used to be ""infected"" / colonised in their stomachs with it. Often killing beneficial bacterial can lead to worse effects than the bad bacteria they were prescribed to treat. The short and narrow is some bacteria that live in the gut prevent other organisms from colonising there and producing harmful chemicals, this may explain the brain fog.

I would recommend avoid meat (eating a vegetarian diet) for a while and drinking kefir / saukraut / anything that may increase the numbers of bacteria that live inside of you. Best of luck!"

If your hotel is anywhere near a train station, the train is much faster (and more consistent) than Uber. I live in Amsterdam and would never consider taking an Uber to/from the airport because it takes twice as long and costs ten times as much."

"A guy I worked with this semester. He was a TA and very smart, fun to talk to and be around, etc. We got along fairly well and went out together a few times. 

He would text me a little too often, would call me several times a day even. But the thing with the calls is he would let it ring for 1-2 seconds and then hang up, which would prompt me to call him back. 

I would say he was just a little too emotional and dare I say slightly clingy for me, which makes me run when it’s not 100% reciprocated on my end. I just can’t handle the constant sugary-sweetness from someone that’s not even my boyfriend. On top of this a girl in our group started treating me unfavorably because he doted on me. Sigh

I feel really badly. He is a great guy but a relationship between us wouldn’t have worked out, and a friendship would require a break that I didn’t see him wanting. I felt like blocking his number and deleting him from snap would be the most humane way of ending it."

"Let's try the question the other way around. Was your seeking God entirely selfless? Was there nothing you were seeking for yourself? Were you seeking only for those around you so that you might be the light for them? How is it even possible to be entirely selfless?

Those who seek to save there lives shall loose it. Those who seek to loose their lives are saved. This requires a continual renewing of our minds that we need to seek God for God's sake and for everyone sake except our own. Our seeking should be from the perspective that we will be persecuted for this endeavor, but He will be glorified.  

Trying to be selfless is how we develop the fruits of the spirit. Where we put others needs before ours. How can I be unkind to someone I Love more than I Love myself? How could I not be patient with them? If I don't Love everyone more then myself, then I might do something that one with good fruit wouldn't do. 

When we get alone with Love and receive His Love, we should in turn become more Loving if not, then why would we receive more Love. So we have to Love Love and seek Love so that we can Love others more than we Love ourselves."

"A lot of people are fluent, but too afraid to speak Ulster-Scots confidently in day-to-day life. In fear of being instantly mocked, for either not speaking 'proper' English, or from the idea that it is somehow a political device.

I'm hesitant to bring it up in conversation at all, for I've heard all the aggression towards it under the sun. Unfortunately, because of its existence under the EU's offical recognition as a minority language, it poses difficult conversations to have when it comes to the Irish Language Act.  A lot of people don't like this, as they see it as an obstacle, so the easiest thing to do is to ridicule it out of existence, which is a sad irony.

I've done quite some research into the Scots-Irish heritage in America, and I do find it just as fascinating."

"You seem to be not considering that people can have _some_ bad beliefs, and make _some_ poor decisions while still also making good decisions and having reasonable beliefs.

You shouldn't take a single subset of beliefs and use that to dismiss a person entirely.  It causes stronger division, which only makes the problem worse."
"I'm not into the frozen sugary coffee beverages, so my opinion probably doesn't count for much. But I did work at Tim Hortons 6-7 years ago. From my perspective, it's clear that Tim's was first on the market with a product that everyone loves. This gave them market dominance.

Since then, it seems like Starbucks has emulated that product. Naturally, a loss in sales should have been ex while also pushing more traditional iced coffees. It seems to me that Tim's has become more of a follower than a trendsetter in the evolution of cold summer-time caffeinated beverages."

"ESH. 

YTA because it seems like you shamed your daughter for beginning to explore her sexuality, which is absolutely normal at her age, and which she was also doing with what she understood to be explicit permission from her mum. Also, isn't if better she starts to explore with toys on her own, than potentially putting herself in unsafe situations with other people?

However, I also think your wife is also the AH. She should have had this discussion and came to a consensus with you way before this even came up, so that when it came time to talk to your 12yo about it, you had a decision in place and could present a united front. There's always the possibility your daughter asked her not to, as she was embarrassed and felt more comfortable talking to her female parent about it.  But it doesn't mean the two if you couldn't have talked about it behind closed doors, and then had mom only do the talking to daughter to make her more comfortable."

"You seem to be very concerned about the idea of masculinity having toxic qualities, is that a correct assumption? What I am saying is that toxic behavior has a particular way of manifesting along side masculinity. Girls don't call each other faggots as a way of establishing a pecking order and policing behavior. Girls may have their own ways of bullying each other, but that is particular to boys/men. Your argument is like seeing someone decry racism and then saying it's unfair to focus it because people are cruel for a whole host of reasons. Narrowing the scope of an argument or issue is useful because it's easier for people affected by that particular issue to engage with it."

"**""I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one guy and I ran away""**, explains the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings

&amp;#x200B;

The popular and much loved character of the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, would surely have faced them sword in hand. But the actor, the real person, has been more cautious. The fact is that the Argentine actor, who has never hidden his passion for football and more specifically for the San Lorenzo de Almagro, to the point that he took a pin from his club during the last Oscars Awards, has explained how he escaped a dangerous brawl with ultras from Real Madrid.

The radical fans attacked him thinking he was a Barcelona fan. It happened in 2006 when Viggo Mortensen, who was immersed in the shooting of Captain Alatriste's film, was mistaken for a Barça supporter.

The actor decided to tell the anecdote 13 years later. It was the day in which his team lost 1-7 against Boca, a match he saw in Madrid with director Agustín Díaz Yanes. The director invited him to dinner at his house, preparing for the occasion. ""I took flags, shirts, hats, scarves ... Then they make us a goal, two goals, three goals ... I sank in the armchair"", reveals in radio 'Vorterix'.

However, the worst came after the game. ""I was in the Puerta del Sol, the ultras saw the colors of my clothing and thought i was a Barça supporter. Those bald guys started to say ugly things and hitting me. I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one and I ran away. ""

When arriving at the house of Agustín Díaz Yanes, the director asked him if it was blood what he wore on his shirt. Not to worry his friend, he said no, that it was wine."

I frankly hope the game do well for a long time, or atleast rework it and make it for consoles down the line. Game is too good for to be discarded like that."

"Omg my wife. Oh hey that ones like $200. 

No it's $289. With tax that's $300, 1.5 times the price you just quoted.

If you are trying to keep a running total while doing anything or estimating costs for a future thing, eating at a restaurant, on vacation, drinking with friends, round up everything to the next first significant figure and you'll have a much more accurate idea of your bill. One night at a hotel while on vacation is $159? That's $200."

"Depends in part on the genre. Most people, for instance, still play Civilization V, not VI, because of the DLC content and mod content. VI is only really now starting to get to traction with its most recent, weighty DLC release.

Strategy games age really well and tend to be very easily moddable with a passionate modder base. They are both content heavy and highly replayable, not graphic/engine heavy, and so they benefit from age if anything (time for more content to be added, don't suffer from aging graphics/engine as bad)

Contrast FPS games on the other side. They don't tend to be content heavy. The ""content"" they do have is generally a mostly one-shot campaign and then the replayability is generated from multiplayer content which *generally* doesn't benefit from age (exceptions are games like the forge in Halo 3 which kept it more popular than 4 or 5 or Halflife which has produced entirely new ecosystems like TF2 and Counterstrike). Rather they're graphics/engine heavy which, I mean you *can* improve over time, but generally at that point you're just releasing a whole new game. 


In fact, that's why you're seeing more games like Anthem and Destiny come about in the FPS space. The core problem all of these companies are trying to solve, either with ""Freemium"" mobiles or MMORPG's, SaaS like Anthem, Destiny, this Paradox/Firaxis installment/DLC method, or even crowdsourced/kickstarter games like Star Citizen, is that relying on every few year windfalls from big game releases is not smart or effective business. 

As a business you want constant and ideally consistent/predictable income. You don't get that from 1 shot or 1 shot + 1 or 2 expansion releases.

Game companies tried to solve this in the 00's by becoming massive huge conglomerates like EA or Activision, companies with so many releases it smooths out the curve. But 1) these big brands aren't the sort of companies that greenlight paradox games and 2) AAA titles have gotten so outrageously expensive they've, relative to the size and stakes involved, are in the same position are smaller companies were in the late 90's where one or two prime properties flopping would kill a company. 

So I think every genre has a form of this, the strategy genre has this Paradox model, and by and large Paradox seems to be doing a fair job with it. 

I extend the same logic to other developers, not all are worth having faith in though."

"This is not a healthy relationship and I think you should end it. You deserve an equal partnership. It seems like this guy is just a leach and I don’t see it changing.

The only way to try to resolve it is to sit down and split up the responsibilities in list form. It’s not your house and he’s helping you out. It’s the house of two people and two people need to do the work. With the list method, you aren’t “nagging” him to “help” you. He has his list and he knows what he has to do. But the way you describe him, I doubt he will.

The first thing I would do is stop doing any of his laundry. Have separate hampers and do not touch his clothes. Then continue with the list, maybe you vacuum and he sweeps/mops, or vice versa. And decide on the frequency. Does it need to be done weekly? Once the list is made, you can see if he’s capable of being the partner you deserve, or if you need to move on and find someone who’s a better match for your energy level."

Now think how much fucking water, pots, and bonfires you'd need to get 1 good pour over the walls at winterfell.

"Don't let Christians and Muslims turn you to bitterness. 

Can I tell you? They are not necessarily happy.

But don't let them make you so bitter that you lash out like this.

Read this gentleman/gentlewoman's comment.

They have also been in so much pain that they had thoughts of harming themselves.

Your response does not see them, even as you call to be seen.

I really am so sorry that your experience with Christianity has been of hate.

But you can turn around and be that face of God for others that you would like to see for yourself.

You don't even need to believe in God. 

Try some kindness even when you feel it's not available for you.

And really - get away from where you are as soon as you can, *but surround yourself with people who know love!*

Because where you are going can be as loveless and hateful as where you are coming from.

Find Peace. Give God a chance.

Define God how you want - you can you know. And then give God a chance."

If you have your phone on your person at all times then there really isn't a threat of somebody installing malware when you aren't present. Also, I don't know of any keyloggers for iOS that exist as the sorts of permissions needed for an application like this are actually impossible for an app to get AS LONG AS YOUR DEVICE ISN'T JAILBROKEN. I'm pretty sure the story about people handling devices in hotel rooms etc. were likely doing that to see if they could find anything already valuable rather than to install malware (though this is purely speculation).

&amp;#x200B;

To answer your questions:

1. Assume that phone calls can be monitored/wiretapped and all sms messages can be read. These really don't have any protection and I'm sure the Chinese government routinely monitors these. That being said Whatsapp is secure and afaik iMessage should be secure as long as you are using iMessage and not just sending sms over the messages app in iOS.
2. While technically this could be possible it is very unlikely. If you open your file in Preview or import in some photo management software and it is an image, it is very-likely safe. That being said, I wouldn't open the file in a [browser](https://www.opswat.com/blog/hacking-pictures-stegosploit-and-how-stop-it). A more common thing to happen in the past would be a file that appeared to be a jpeg but was in fact an executable that if you clicked on would run a malicious program; if the picture is in fact interpreted as a picture then it should be fine.
3. Changing passwords can't hurt but personally I wouldn't do it if I knew I was using a service that uses https because this stuff is encrypted to website.
4. I don't think that taking out the battery would help if the camera had somehow gotten malware on it. Once again, as far as I know there are no known exploits for Mac which would automatically run when you plug a camera into your computer so I don't think this will actually happen."

"I'm struggling with this too. I think it's good to form your own opinions and thoughts. While I think it's good to connect with people, you don't have to be someone people just see as a mirror. Remember that it's okay if you don't agree with someone else's ideas and opinions.

Try taking up a new hobby or learning something new-- not because someone else likes it, but because you do. Take time to practice self care and love, and just basically live your best life. It's perfectly fine to make mistakes and get messy along the way.

"Well that's interesting, why did the collection company wait so long?! Stupid, got us hyped for nothing!"
"There's only so much space. If you're a developer, you know that the most profit is in building units targeted towards the very wealthy, so any inch of space that you can get your hands on, you're going to turn it into ultralux spaces reserved for the super rich. This is great for the super rich as they can afford to buy a unit (or several) that's very spacious, but it leaves less housing for the less-than-super rich...many of those units get turned into housing for the very rich, which is still very profitable, and others get turned into housing for the rich, which is still profitable. That means less and less housing targeted for the middle class is available. 


Most of this is just a symptom of economic forces - there's been enough demand that developers could get away with only building units for the rich as they would get bought, while the rest of the housing stock is left to rot while people who desperately want to live in NY still rent it because it's worth it to them, and they're even willing to pay very high prices to do that.


But, now, we're starting to reach something of a breaking point where people are realizing that the only realistically affordable housing is shitty, and you can rent a three-bedroom McMansion in Georgia with a garage for like $1500 a month. So people are starting to say fuck it and leave."

"What they need are GAMES, not the current crop of very short tech demos.  There are a few really awesome games out there that I really enjoyed playing, but I'm not going to spend console like money just to play a few games.  IMO they should be trying to convince developers why they should give their games a VR mode, why try to reinvent the wheel?  Original content costs a lot, but having new and upcoming games support VR would be much cheaper.  Valve can supply the tools and some financial support.

&amp;#x200B;

The other issue is cost, VR headsets are still way too much IMO.  In particular when you factor in having wireless capability which is another must IMO.  I'm happy they got rid of the base stations, but being tethered to my PC has got to go."

I think it's a vague term. 

&gt;I think it's divisive, and only contributes to simplify a complex situation and further polarize us all while putting widely different people and opinions into narrow boxes. 

&gt;And see, in your post you already put me in a box, without knowing anything about me except this single comment of mine you saw today.

&gt;This type of modern political language and thinking is just holding us back, I think.

&gt;It just contributes to lazy binary thinking. Left/Right. Red/Blue etc.. 
Sure, it's mentally convenient and easy, but it feels like those cognitive shortfalls are having a pretty severe effects on our society. Which is of course magnefied today by how connected we are on the internet. 

&gt;And I'm saying this from a human-centric perspective. It's way above ideologies and political leanings, because it's actually holding our species back from advancing. 

&gt;I hope you don't take this as personal criticism, cause it's really just about the subject, which I also find interesting. 
I wonder if humanity is prone to this kind of thinking, maybe it's a byproduct of how our brains work.

"Yeah, I started taking along an anti-Wolf weapon whenever I'm leveling somewhere that's not (E)SO."
"I'm going out on a limb that ESH because I have a story to tell.  Actually, two stories.  My daughter had known it was expected that at 12-ish, I have access to that information should I choose to take a look.  Funny thing is, I never used it but came across some issues completely by surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

She was waking up in the morning EXTREMELY tired having gone to bed when she would have gotten 9+ hours of sleep.  I was still getting Verizon paper bills then and saw that she had sent a HUGE number of texts, to the tune of 8700 in the previous month...on a dumb phone with a slider keyboard.  At that point, she was working on the trust of having more freedom and doing well, until I found the obnoxious number of texts going until 3 am.  Her phone was limited to contacts in her phone for texting.  What she had learned, was that if she couldn't text someone, they could text her and she could reply.  I wasn't paying for service that would restrict it that much because..well, she needs to be trusted.

&amp;#x200B;

That number of texts and her tiredness in the mornings got me looking at that month's texts, which led to finding at least 3 males requesting nudes, which she didn't send (awesome!).  That led to authorities in three states becoming involved and the issue eventually went away.  More of a scare the hell out them likely happened as to my knowledge no charges were filed because she hadn't actually sent any.

&amp;#x200B;

The other story was her Google+ account.  I used G+ at one point to communicate with a software beta group and one of her posts came up in my feed.  I looked at comments on one picture and found that a guy in town told her she was cute and said they should meet.  It turns out that he was a registered sex offender and worked just a few miles away.  He and I had a discussion and he disappeared from the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Both were used as teachable moments because to learn safe behavior and when to spot trouble, but she did have her privileges and access scaled back for a while.  The hammer came down, but not so much on her, as the walking hormones that tried to exploit her.

&amp;#x200B;

"Anger and vengeance aren't odd and yes I'm a human being who experiences a wide spectrum of emotions like anyone else. But insisting that because I'm angry of vengeful justifies anything I do is absurd.

Is it okay to feel a sense of anger and vengeance from watching that video? Yes. Is it okay to assume because I'm feeling angry and vengeful it justifies excessive use of violence? No, and that's the problem this his mindset and apparently those supporting him. 

You can't possibly believe just because someone is angry it justifies any degree of violence. Going out of ones way to insist that the animal needed to be hurt beyond the reasonable amount just because ""I was feeling angry."" Is psychopathic."

Those statements were a) made before the show and b) the show is its own thing. So until there is a definitive statement made by the showrunners/characters themselves, it's all speculation.

Furthermore, we don't know if Viserion's fire would work the same as regular dragon fire. We did see Viserion try to scorch one of the dragons in the sky and it seemed really unfazed. Drogon and Rhaegal never even tried to hit Viserion with fire, either. Now that it's dead we'll never know.

I imagine we'll find out before the season ends if he is fireproof. Jon vs. Viserion kind of feels like foreshadowing more than anything else."

Was taught to come in under sail but at this place, the prevailing winds generally make that impossible.  Sailing up the fairway is too narrow to tack and against the wind.  I had my sails up anyway and was motoring in at about 1.5mph... then when was starting to turn in to the slip, I realized that while the boom was clear of the pylons, the falls were not, kind of panicked and sheeted in hard and just got pinned with the bow stuck to the end of one finger and the transom another, \*almost\* like I meant to do that.  I was able to tie her there and drop the sail and pull her in.  People were watching the pretty sailboat.

Since the instructor officially knew what they were doing and the person testing was supposed to call out anything wrong, I kept my mouth shut but as it was happening we all figured out that that was not part of the lesson.  


Got waked in a narrow and busy channel and my anchor jumped ship while I was alone.  That was one of the scarier moments but amazingly stayed off the rocks and the other boats stayed off of me.  Drug anchor while I was trying to set anchor and went in to the rocks.  I knew I was dragging but it was blowing hard but dealing with an anchor full of weeds and the sail up and the boat quickly falling off to a run and making the wrong decision to try to clear the anchor and throw it out again instead of sailing I biffed it.  Lost three battens that night but one landed in the cockpit so there's that."

"The entire battle was anticlimactic. What makes something tense and engaging is to have a fairly equal fight with lots of back and forth. The Night King's army was so strong, it was obvious that it would come down to a single heroic action since the only other option of complete annihilation was out due to plot armor. The weakness to a single stab was almost as boring as if someone had shown up from an expedition to the ruins of Valeria with an unearthed ancient nuclear weapon and they simply glassed the whole undead army. ""Stab and now tens of thousands of enemies are now dead after just one battle"" is not interesting. If the army of the living were routed and scattered in all directions, a several episode plot of multiple assassination attempts would have been interesting. Surviving groups would be hunted down one by one, giving a sense of urgency. Instead, 7 seasons of buildup was ended by a single stab."

"I've been really tempted to do step 3 of the Easter step-up. I'm at 9700 lapis, so I definitely can't finish the lap. If I complete this most recent story release, I'll still be far short of 15k lapis. I already pulled my 2 Esther but I'm missing and still wanting Sylvie. I know step 3 is a complete shot in the dark. I'm not really hoarding for anyone at this time, but maybe for the summer units.

So I'm looking for opinions on either play the gamble game and most likely loose or just UoC my first Sylvie. I currently have 20 tickets but I won't spend both on her. The better half of my brain tells me to just UoC, since Sylvie gets the bulk of her kit at 6 star anyways and save for the summer (or other) units. Golbez, depending on his upgrades, looks tempting, since I'm lacking mages. My best are finishers with BS Sakura and Emperor. (Edit: If I need CW frames in a pinch, I do have 7 star Beryl)."

"Sneak Attack

&gt; Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack ***if you have advantage on the attack roll***. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

Help

&gt; Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, ***the first attack roll is made with advantage***."

"This is actually common hoarder behavior. They are very critical of the cleanliness of other people’s homes, or how well other people clean in general. Their house will be completely trashed, but they will come to your house and immediately point out dust on the air vent, or dried up gummy soap on the dish detergent bottle. In your case your mil criticizes the fact that you didn’t wash all of her dishes. She isn’t going to do it herself, but she will surely rake you across the coals. I don’t know why they do this. Maybe it’s because they feel better when they put other people down. Don’t be fooled, hoarders know that their house is disgusting. They just don’t want to do anything about it.

My SIL used to work her butt off to clean her mother’s hoard. She thought she was helping, but her mother would just complain and criticize SILs efforts. Eventually I was able to convince my SIL that this wasn’t her responsibility, and clearly MIL didn’t appreciate the effort. I suggest you also stop clean and cooking at your MILs house. Go out to eat, or bring a covered dish from your own house. It isn’t your responsibility to clean your MILs filthy house, or cook for her. So just stop."

"Q1 - 7 eliminated

Q2 - 7 eliminated

Q3 - top 6 drivers in superpole going one by one for pole position.

Everyone knows the top 6 will be the Merc, Ferrari and Red Bull, so it means the midfield will be set in Q2 rather than wasting another set of tyres on getting 1-2 positions up the grid. It also means that p7-10 won't get a disadvantage on p11/12 from tyres. 

It means that drivers actually fight for pole and the ones better under pressure will generally do better, rather than giving everyone two runs and leaving the cars to decide where people qualify, unpredictability is always good.

It's a very small change but keeping the same philosophy as before. I'm not saying it needs to be changed, but it needs to update to 2019 and not be stuck in the past."

Many of these figures have expressed a strong disdain for democracy as a concept, and believe their political ideology is more important than any ""will of the people"".

"Try to find the little things about the job that sort of boost your happiness. Even though being social burns me out so quick and easily, I do still love having short and pleasant conversations with random strangers. Though I don't usually initiate convos so not every customer interaction turns into a pleasant conversation, and instead is just they place their order, we say nothing to each other while the chip reader works on their card, then I tell them they're good to walk away (the transaction is complete) (I usually literally just say ""and you're good!"" letting them know everything went through ok on my end and they can go wait for their order) and they say thanks and walk away. But when a little pleasant convo happens with a customer it makes me a bit happier about my time spent there. 

Are there other tasks that the cashiers have to do sometimes that don't require customer interaction when doing them? I usually work register at my job, but everyone there is expected to be able to do every aspect of the job, and since I'm usually the pre closer I'm usually the one who winds up sweeping and cleaning floors about an hour before my shift is over. I think technically they want us to interact with customers when we're in the lobby, but no one's ever called me out for not interacting when I clean the floors lol. It takes about 30-40 minutes, and I can just be mostly in my head and don't really have to talk to others when doing it unless a customer asks me a question directly (like if they ask what time we close or something). Maybe you can ask your manager to incorporate some tasks like this into your shifts so that you can break up the shift some so that you aren't having to interact with customers the entire shift. Like where some chunks you still help customers, but then there are other chunks where you stop to clean your station and don't take customers, or you go back to clean the employee break room or something. It's nice to have some sort of little break from interactions during your shift, even if it's just 15 minutes, it still gives a small moment to recharge. 

Idk...I'm basically in a similar boat, so I don't know if any of this helps. My old manager, and my current manager both know that I'm best with shorter shifts, because I get too exhausted from the interactions at around the 4 hour mark. But my store had an assistant manager working as the manager when I first got to this new store because the manager was on leave, and she's now a manager of her own store, and when she was my manager, and the few times I've helped cover shifts at her store she schedules people for insanely long shifts, and I just can not lol. Her scheduling ways were really frustrating."

In the start of the 4komas Ayumu was petty and passive aggressive, but then it gets revealed that she was possessed by a demon and that's why she was mean. She does seem a bit strange afterwards, but that's only because the Famitsu App 4koma is weird and has stuff like the trio going to Mars (which is referenced in her call and response), fighting aliens, and Ayumu having a gigantic pet snake. Every other bit of content has Ayumu as a kind person with some self esteem issues, but not mean at all."

\&gt;I'm not denying it whatsoever  


I understand you're not denying it, but what's your rationale for still using conditionals? Like, do you really doubt it after seeing the links shared and reading the pages in context? I came here thinking ""gosh it seems like a community of people being silly, is there a chance that they were Pepe fans before he was appropriated by the alt right?"" But after seeing the context-- nosefrens for jews, Honk Honk everywhere, links to holocaust denial pages called Strange\_Statistics, and on and on... when you go back a second time with that perspective in mind, you'd have to be daft to have any doubt left in your mind.

As to your question, why not? It's a social group. It's no different from BSing on 4chan or somewhere else. It's people being social, and what they have in common is white nationalism. They have fun with it, serving the dual purpose of evading a ban by being opaque, and entertaining themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't look at it as if it's meant to be some kind of educational or advocacy subreddit for holocaust deniers. This isn't like flat\_earth where the content is documentaries and arguments to prove a point. This is people who already agree on a set of beliefs just looking for somewhere to be social and have fun with each other and mock anyone who doesn't share their views."
"Do it like this:  


Footage int tracker, then track the point and in the tracker set it to Matchmove BG only.  
Then add your wand since now the image is still and the movement wont mess with your sample section.   


after the wand does whatever your doing add a copy of the tracker to the comp and plug a BG node in to the gold input and your comp into the green, then set the matchmover settings from BG only to FG only.  


This technique lets you stabilize your source, then do work on the still, then re introduce the movement so the work now moves as if it was tracked."

"Thank you for the response and I learned a few things as well.  :-).  Respectfully disagree with your conclusion.  In my humble opinion, That was said for a reason directly related to this case and it has both a literal and figurative implication, my hypothesis is it was included by seasoned profilers who communicated something to the killer that only he would know.   While I don’t want to think about it as it is absolutely horrific, you can’t rule out an actual shack.  Maybe they just located it w/ help of a witness and found useable DNA.  Complete speculation but it would explain why the family would  be devastated and needed time to process the new info and the new direction.  If you were the killer, this would  scare the shit out of you as you know your time is up.  Plus the press notes say we have a witness and you made mistakes.  Just a theory obviously but the shack reference was very significant to solving this case in my opinion."

The customer loyalty they made us grow even if I fucking sucked (I didn’t) at making coffee was insane.

""A cue is (1) a signal prompting an event or action, especially in a performance; and (2) the long stick used to strike the cue ball in billiards and pool. The word also works as a verb meaning give a cue. A queue is (1) a line of people waiting for something, and (2) a hair braid worn down the back of the neck. As a verb, queue means get in line or place in line. Both these homophones are often used with up—cue up meaning prepare \[something\] to start on cue, and queue up meaning get in line."" - [https://grammarist.com/usage/cue-queue/](https://grammarist.com/usage/cue-queue/)"

"Sugar in blood triggers insulin to be released. Insulin floods your cells with glucose. It does this by mixing it with water and it lets the sugar into every cell in your body. When you trigger an insulin response, not only do your cells flood with with glucose and cause inflammation, your body holds as much water as it can because your cells have been drastically deprived of glucose on the Keto diet and it needs that water to put the glucose in the cells. Even a small amount of sugar can throw ketosis out of whack. It’s tricky, but the benefits of the diet are very much worth it imho."

"I noticed on the recommendation charts for both fox and Rockshox that it seems rebound should is almost inversely proportional to air pressure. Example, a lightweight rider won’t have much air pressure, but the fork recommendations have the damper rebound almost to full bunny. Where as the heavier rider may have a lot of pressure, but the damper will be backed down closer to turtle mode. 

I was kind of thrown off by it, but in a way it makes sense for a few reasons. Let’s pretend you have quality points of 100. If you have 80 points coming from air, you only need the damper to fill in the remaining 20. If you have 20 points coming from air then you’ll need 80 quality points to fill the gap coming from the damper. If you’re a heavier rider, there is no need to make the damper work extra hard, you’ll wear it out sooner. Let the air do it. If you’re a light rider, the damper doesn’t need to work as hard so you can set it higher to make up for the fact there isn’t much air. I hope this is making sense.

To answer your question in the scope of personal preference, I came off a Release as well and now I run a 160 front/ 160 rear bike. I weigh 200lbs. I run 20% sag on my front Rockshox yari. I run 25% sag on my rear Rockshox deluxe. Because I’m heavier, but I also like a decent amount of rebound (preference), I run 12 out of 20 clicks toward full bunny on my fork. And I run 5 out of ten clicks towards full bunny on my rear shock. I’m just a click or 2 closer to bunny than what’s recommended for my weight."

He knows not having to deal with that is a privilege, but wants to deny that privilege exists, so he starts TD'ing about the cultural appropriation meme where he can play the victim.   

Because admitting you have privilege means admitting you're not just naturally better than everyone and that sheer luck has played a significant role for everyone, good or bad. And that's not something people like that want to think about."

"That's very interesting. This was my first time watching  John Cedars, except for the Bottlegate video which I felt was over sensationalized. My husband also served in bethel, in the mid 90's. When I was still fully in he told me a story about a friend he had there that quit bethel abruptly and decided he didn't want to be one of jws anymore. He took him to lunch to pick his brain, he thought he was going to solve his questions and get him to come back. But the friend wouldn't discuss what he was conflicted with, and my husband decided that jehovah must've just taken the truth away from him because he was doing something he shouldn't have been. That tends to be his go-to when he can't refute certain things. In hindsight, the friend likely just saw through his motives and didn't want to participate in the discussion. I'm very curious as to what changed for him that made him want to leave. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I usually don't have much to say, but when I get on this sub I start rambling. Thanks for taking your time to do the tell-all. I appreciate the honesty and the compassion you have for your former friends."

"Quality. 90% of their games are instant hits for me. 5% are just not my thing but I can see the appeal, and the rest are games I actually thought were mediocre to bad.

"I can't recall the actual name, but there's a whole process you can do to ground yourself. It's all about senses and noticing the things around you and how your own body feels. That'll come up in this.

There are a few that I'll talk about, but feel free to research for more that fit you better. The major one that you should always try first is focusing on your breathing.   During anxiety attacks, or anything alike, you can often become short of breath because you completely zone out on it and focus more on the nerves going through you. Push your shallow and panicked breaths to deep breaths that fill your belly. You can also shut your eyes while you do deep breaths to fully focus your mind on your breathing instead of what you're seeing . 

Another thing that, personally, works very well is doodling. It doesn't have to be a good doodle or even mean anything. The whole point is to move your hand and focus on the lines you're creating. Draw a big circle and slowly swirl it inwards until it's teeny tiny. You can do it with a pencil on paper, paint brush on canvas, pen on napkin, anything you have at your disposal that you can draw with.

Drink icy water. You can really feel freezing water going down your esophagus into your intestines and stomach. It's a great way to automatically focus your mind on the inner workings of your body and how cold that water is. It also helps to hydrate during stressful times. Icy water also aids in clearing your mind.

Now, circling back to the first paragraph (sorry this is so long lmao), there's this thing to notice all five of your senses to ground yourself. It goes:

- Find 5 things you can see
- 4 things you can touch
- 3 things you can hear
- 2 things you can smell
- 1 thing you can taste

This exercise forces you to zone in on what's going on and specifically what you can sense in each category. 

So these work primarily for panic attacks, but it can also work after a flashback, nightmare, etc. I've used them for everything rough under the sun and they've become invaluable tools to help with my mental health.

I hope this helps!"

It has its flaws but the body part destruction system is great-- you can target specific body parts on enemies to cut them off for a chance at stealing their weapons and other gear.

Going forward, I will be surprised to see them out of t3 in any event or league standings. But anything can happen at events, any team can win. Just comes down to who shows up that weekend. A team can win an event and not be the best team in the game, that should be common knowledge. Look at how LG does in the league, and it's lan so there should be no difference. And honestly if you're looking at the best team, you should be looking at the league record this year. Like I said it's on lan unlike previous years, and there is a larger sample of games than at an event. Obvious there are differences between the 2, like nerves playing a huge factor, but then they should be both looked at separately and important in their own way.

"Makes sense that you'd imagine that at first glance. I think most people assume that to be the case to be honest. 

Modular psus have to be able to support a wide variety of cable combinations, so often times they'll go for a unified port that can handle various runs.

As an example, the corsair rm1000 uses eps cpu power 8pin connectors on its body for everything from sata to pcie and peripheral runs. It also uses both a 10 pin and an 18 pin to run 24 pin motherboard power.

For warranty information you will want to check the manufacturer as the small print could be different for each."

This is very important.  Not like ""he admits it and thus can recover.""  

But there's a lot of situations where someone is portrayed as having a mental breakdown when that person disagrees.

"'Triangles per second' actually used to be one of those metrics that would get thrown around to show how 'good' a GPU was.  It had a similar problem to the 'teraflops' which are being thrown around today because theoretical triangle rates were rarely close to what you would get in reality. It was always technically true but there was also always some secondary factor that would limit real life performance.

In fact, GPUs from a whole decade ago already had theoretical triangle rates in the range of 1-2 billion triangles per second which, at 60fps, should mean 15-30m triangles per frame.  Yet, even today, games are still nowhere near having these kinds of triangle counts.  I always find it best to ignore theoretical numbers because they're by and large mostly meaningless.

As far as the PS5 is concerned, I'm mostly curious about memory capacity and bandwidth because those tend to be somewhat meaningful numbers.  We already know that PS4 Pro has 218GB/s of bandwidth on a 256-bit bus and, assuming GDDR6 at 14gbps, then PS5 will likely either have 448GB/s on a 256-bit bus or 672GB/s on a 384-bit bus.  I know many people assume 16GB of capacity but I think it may well be higher than that."

"I don't get this. I can not imagine being so angry or fed up with my kids that I would cut them off. I might as well cut off a hand or foot. My kids are amazing.  My mother was not. She thought I was horrible. She would have cut me off if I had actually done something to shame her but I was never that bad. Still, she always put me down and refused to help me when I needed it. (When my 31 yr old husband was having heart surgery and I'd asked her to please come and babysit my kids so I could go to the city where he was in the hospital,  she refused - but did send a cheque for $50 to hire a sitter.) I was not devoted to her - I gave up trying to please her and kept my distance to limit the hurt but I never cut her off. I was told not to come visit one Christmas - not for any particular reason. I think she just really wanted to stick it to me. So we took the kids to Mexico instead.  A year or so before she died, she sold her condo and moved to a retirement home - she never told us she was sick. I did most of her packing up. The last day I was cleaning out her storage locker, a neighbor saw me and chewed me out for not calling her every day. ok. She did not trust me, but her favourite insisted that she give me her power of attorney when she got too sick. She kept making comments that I was stealing her money. I wasn't. But I spent a lot of time with her and something made her see me in a new light. She actually admitted, at the ate of 92, that she had not been fair to me and she could have helped me out more (as she had my siblings).  That was nice.

And I took the maximum amount allowed by law as executor of her estate when she died."

Background investigations are good for up to 2 years after leaving federal employment.  You would still need fingerprints to have your ID badge made though.  Our eqips are issued and once completed are sent to opm.  Opm then returns the results to another hr specialist in that hiring office that is responsible for making a suitability determination.   If you don't need a new BI you won't get eqip link.  The hr office can verify your current background investigation in a program called PIPS.

"&gt;It also borders Somalia which is not completely “Arab”,

Somalia is in the Arab league and the Arab world. That's Arab enough. 

&gt;but let’s just stick with India and Pakistan.

The Arabian sea is a small section of the greater Indian Ocean, so I don't think they much care what that body of water is called as it would be part of the greater Indian Ocean. 


&gt;I brought that up because the gulf Arabs are the ones asking for a name change of the Persian gulf, basically to show the hypocrisy.

What hypocrisy? Are you saying the Arabian peninsula doesn't border the gulf between Iran and the Arabian peninsula?

&gt;What possible reason would they have for changing the name of a historical body or water other than hatred

Pride. 

Arabs and Persians are people. And people like feeling like that they are great and important. 

I'm not trying to insult Iran and its people, I myself genuinely like Persian culture and history.

But gulf Arabs don't really hate Persians. They just don't care about you or think about you all that much. 


I know the media likes to spin a fancy story of Arabs and Persians being mortal enemies and rivals, but reality is very different. 


Maybe you think about us much, even though in my time in being subscribed to this subreddit, you seem more concerned with your own country than ours. 


But maybe average Iranians are different than average Iranians redditors, I don't know much besides what I see here and on the news.


What I DO know is that you aren't much of a topic here, of either hate or love. At least in Saudi Arabia you aren't. 


I personally don't hold any grudge towards Persians. 


After all, one of the prophet companions and commanders and the one who in some part significantly contributed to Muhammad's successes, was a Persian. 

His name was Salman al-Farsi or Salman the Persian.

&gt;The Arabian Sea borders huge non Arab countries, but those countries feel no need to change the name. Why is that?

Like I said above, it's because they don't much care as the Arabian sea is part of the greater Indian Ocean. And the fact they themselves have better things to do than care what body of water is called what. 

&gt;There is literally a historical map in a museum in the UAE with the name “Persian” scratched off. This is all coming from pure hatred.

If that is actually true, they shouldn't damage or deface artifacts because they don't their narrativ. Whether the artifacts are based on truths/opinions or not. Because it cheapens them in my opinion regardless of the fact if they are based on truths or opinions or neither. 

&gt;In Iran it can be called Persian gulf In Arab countries it can be called “whatever you want to call it” gulf The internationally recognized term was, is and will remain Persian gulf

People will call that piece of water whatever they please regardless of facts or opinions  or whether it hurts your feelings or mine, and the best either one of us can do is loudly complain. 

&gt;Sound fair?

You sound very attached to this piece of water in our 70% water planet. 


Not willfully trying to undermine your feelings. 

But besides the natural resources in the gulf, it's doesn't really much matter. 


Especially if whether or not it's called Persian or Arabian."

"Ok, donc tu ignores complètement le fait que les français au Québec ont été traités comme des citoyens de deuxième classe jusqu'aux années 80. Les boomers ont été pratiquement les premiers à se permettre une éducation supérieure et devenir entrepreneurs. Chose qui était impensable auparavant, car c'était une élite anglaise qui était à la tête du marché et si tu n'étais pas anglais, personne ne voulais faire d'affaires avec toi.

Ignore le fait que les français étaient dicriminés par les anglais et n'étaient pas les bienvenus dans des magasins à cause de leur langue et leur culure.

Ignore ce que des générations à être traités ainsi a pu faire à notre génération courante, surtout du point de vu d'héritage en bien et financier, comparé aux anglais qui ont pu se permettre de donner un riche héritage à leurs enfants et qui se sont vu avoir un accès plus facile à l'éduation et à la proprité comparé aux français.

Ferme toi les yeux sur notre histoire et les conséquences que ça a eu sur nous aujourd'hui.

Je ne dis pas qu'on est pas bien au Québec, mais on pourrait être sacrément mieux. Il s'agirait pour toi de voyager, sortir du pays et aller voir ailleurs, comme en France, par exemple, où cette discrimination n'a pas eu lieu et de voir combien la richesse s'est transférée entre générations comparés aux Québécois.

As soon as I saw the main character wearing a cross on a chain I was hoping it wouldn't go in that direction, but it did. For a highly anticipated sci-fi fantasy flick, they could have done SO much with the endless possibilities in regards to the origins of pretty much everything, but instead it was just, 'god did it'."

"Of course not. One could still keep the percentage from 0-100%, and put uncertainty at 50%. 

0% - I am certain this is false.

"I know when she met him. She was pretty open about the whole thing but I wasn't expecting her to really want to see other people on a separation.

She was honest about the whole thing so I still have hopes that we can see through all of this and she'll see the relationship we have together."
"&gt; They can pull the 5 class license too or assess enough points to make the driver no longer qualify. 

That's right, but if they can pull the class 4 and leave the class 5 they can take a more surgical approach to licensing without forcing people into an all-or-nothing situation where they lose their license to drive in any setting because they're a shitty chauffeur.

There's nothing incongruent about my argument.  It has remained the same throughout all of this.  Licensing is a form of control that makes it much faster and easier to respond in the event of a problem than having to do everything through the courts.

I don't know why you're having such a hard time understanding that.  It's a fundamental fact of how our society operates, ***especially*** in a commercial setting.

When your entire argument hinges around, ""it's political"" in the face of entirely viable alternatives, your argument is bullshit.

So just stop."

**Article**:

&gt; HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A federal judge threw out former Penn State President Graham Spanier’s misdemeanor child-endangerment conviction on Tuesday, less than a day before he was due to turn himself in to begin serving a jail sentence.

&gt; The decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Karoline Mehalchick in Scranton, Pennsylvania, gave state prosecutors three months to retry Spanier under the state’s 1995 child endangerment law, the version in place in 2001.

&gt; Joe Grace, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office, said the decision was under review. Spanier’s defense lawyer, Sam Silver, declined to comment.

&gt; Mehalchick agreed with Spanier that he was improperly charged under a 2007 law for actions that occurred in 2001, when he was responding to a complaint about former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky showering with a boy on campus.

&gt; “Spanier submits that this retroactive application is unreasonable and far more extensive than anyone in 2001 would have been able to reasonably foresee,” Mehalchick wrote. “The court agrees.”

&gt; Spanier had been due to report to jail early Wednesday to begin serving a minimum sentence of two months, followed by two months of house arrest.

&gt; Spanier, 70, was forced out as Penn State president shortly after Sandusky was arrested in 2011 on child molestation charges. A year later, Spanier was accused of a criminal cover-up, although many of those charges were dismissed by an appeals court. The jury acquitted him of what remained by the time of his trial, except for the single count of child endangerment.

&gt; Lisa Powers, a university spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Spanier remains a tenured faculty member on paid administrative leave.

&gt; Spanier’s lawyers argued that the application of the law to acts that occurred years before the measure was passed violated the state and federal constitutions’ ban on retroactive application of criminal laws. The child endangerment revisions in 2007 applied the law to those “employing or supervising” people who were responsible for the welfare of a minor child.

&gt; But the judge did not agree with their argument that the statute of limitations had been improperly applied.

&gt; Prosecutors had argued the 1995 and 2007 versions of the law encompassed and criminalized the same conduct.

&gt; Spanier was convicted for how he and two of his top aides decided to respond to a report from graduate assistant coach Mike McQueary that he had seen Sandusky abusing the boy late on a Friday night in a team shower.

&gt; Spanier has said the abuse of the boy, who has never been conclusively identified, was characterized to him as horseplay.

&gt; Spanier and two of his top lieutenants, former athletic director Tim Curley and former vice president Gary Schultz, agreed to notify The Second Mile, the charity for at-risk youth where Sandusky met many of his victims, but not to call police.

&gt; Spanier gave his approval to his deputies in an email, warning that “the only downside for us is if the message isn’t ‘heard’ and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it.”

&gt; Curley and Schultz were also charged criminally for their actions regarding Sandusky, but on the eve of trial they both pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment and testified for the prosecution. Both have since served similar jail sentences.

&gt; Spanier did not testify at his trial and told the judge at sentencing that he regretted not intervening more forcefully.

&gt; Sandusky is doing 30 to 60 years in state prison and recently won an order for a new sentence.

"I have a friend that suicidal currently. My brother killed himself last year, hundreds of people came to his funeral, all talking about how they wished they could have done something (and in fairness, he refused to open up to anyone even those who knew he was having troubles). They've made books for his children and fixated on him now for the past 12 months. 

My suicidal friend has seen them do this, seen all the effort the put in to caring for a dead person while she's been ignored the entire time. They don't know how to help her, they don't reach out to her, she's left to face it all on her own without much support. 

From her perspective, they glorify the dead and don't care for the living. That makes her even more suicidal, because she feels that if she dies, then at least they'll notice and care.

At the funerals they all claim they would have done *anything* to stop it happening. They almost never live up to that hype. I don't think someone killing themselves to escape isolated suffering is the worst thing they can do, the most selfish act a person can do is to ignore those they claim to care about as they suffer indefinitely."
why is this happening
"Sooooo unconventional keto, I know... But bean dip and chicken salad. Not together. 
The bean dip is an entire brick of cream cheese spread over the bottom of a smaller cake pan or casserole dish. Next, spread half a can of no bean chili. Then sprinkle shredded cheese on top.  Heat in oven on 400 till cheese is gooey.
The chxn salad dressing is equal parts mayo and sour cream, with a bit of lemon juice. Add it to shaved almonds, chicken, celery, green onion. Season to taste.
Both of these are delicious, easy to take with, fill you up, and make you poop. 
Also cobb salad."

All you are explaining are the reasons people want the bots, and I am not disagreeing with that in anyway. The reasons you claim its not fun are all fixed by the bots, so of course people that wan't to play like that go right ahead. And you are right, I CAN just go to any other world and do it as intended. I COULD go out and find some other players who'd be willing to do it and get at it.. or alternatively I could just hop onto a world dedicated to doing it.

Obviously I'm not \*literally\* the only person who would participate in the full activity. Like I said, the bots just cater to min/max type players which, I agree, is the majority of people. But I could care less about effeciency/max xp rates/etc. I'd much rather just have access to the activity just to do it. I like roleplaying and doing activities, even if they aren't the most efficient or 'pointless' to everyone else. It's just a completely different play style.

I'm not sure why you are attempting to convince me that I wouldn't enjoy it =P It seriously sounds right up my alley. I feel like you think I'm against having the bot worlds and I'm not, I just don't understand why there aren't ALSO at least a couple worlds specifically for the group activity aspect of it. It wouldn't hurt anyone, and it allows the few of us who do want to participate a simple way to connect. I mean if Fishing Trawler gets its own world why can't Blast Furnace?"

At least in terms of gay marriage in the West, the culture war seems to have been won."

I've found this about the military just in general. People who make it a career get really salty about anyone who gets out because they can do better on the outside. They're constantly trying to prove to themselves that they've made the right decision to make it a career.
"You have every right to be angry at her and no one is forcing you to forgive her or anything. But if she had as much involvement with your dad in her life as you did, then it’s understandable that it’s fucked her up in some way. 

After or during abuse, people can go one of two ways. One way is to allow yourself to inflict your suffering into others as a type of coping mechanism. The other way is to take your suffering and use it as a What Not To Do guide and treat others with the kindness you craved.

Try talking with her. Maybe the knowledge of what she’s doing and how it’s making you feel might allow her to see things from your perspective. If it doesn’t, well, my best advice would be to find a way out of this relationship."

It's a story driven action rpg widely considered to be among one of the best games ever made. Hard to say any game is really similar, some try like dragon age inquisition but that's like comparing an infant to an adult. 

I'd suggest to watching a review &amp; recap of story. The complete edition comes with all dlc, the 2 big expansions are also considered the best examples of dlc being done right. Great story with ton more content that might ever be better made than the game. All this &amp; complete edition is usually on sale for $15-20 very often"

"1) This is not true - I moved from MA to WA and most states do not support license reciprocity. Further, many states require national board certification, MA does not recognize this at all. https://www.nbpts.org/national-board-certification/

2) I served as a union representative for 3 years. Mostly, teachers complain to the union reps, the reps relay this to admin, and admin and the union come up with a plan to say something that will calm everyone down. A few instances of someone not being compensated at the correct step given their years of experience and education were observed, but never anything that contributed to MA being such a great state for education. I'm curious what you think the 98% union membership does?

3) Why are so many topics required? Tell me - what is your average 11th grader going to do with the complex plane in the next 30 year of their life? What about polynomial factorization? There exist a small percentage of high school children who will ever think about these topics again after 3rd period. Sure - logic and reasoning is helpful - but it is an obstructively long list of things that mostly don't matter that everyone is subjected to. It actually looks like its intended to make sure most people don't understand math and science by the time they finish high school. More than half of college students who choose math as their major switch out within 3 years - they were not adequately prepared. There are no programming standards included in a framework that was designed in the internet age. Instead, they drone on about Algebra 2 and Pre-calc when approximately 1% of students nationwide will ever benefit from that.

4) There isn't a state that does it the best. That's my point. The whole thing is broken."

So let me get this straight, the prospect of free Pizza was more important to you than using the bathroom before you left the house to insure you didn't shit yourself? Why does this need explaining?

"Catching people out ends games but winning teamfights, forcing Baron, splitpushing, etc. also ends games.

There are some hook champions that scale well, like Pyke, but the vast majority do not.

However, it's widely agreed that Thresh is very dominant in both laning phase and early game roams. 

---

Hooks can solo win games, but *most* hook champions can't do nearly as much as champions like Sona or Janna late game in a teamfight.

Talon is also incredibly good at catching people out, and can even do it solo, but he's also one of the weakest scalers in the game simply because he's miserable at everything else late game."

"Also forgot to add, some ults are fine to be used on low hp targets for clean up, but ults like Fenrir, area, daji, kumbrakna, Cerberus, Odin, amasuatra these are all set up ults should be use to either engage a fight, or to get a pick on high priory targets before a team fight even starts. 

Then say Scylla her ult is best used on clean up as if it kills it resets so you can use to to clean up 1 or 2 kills and then deal big damage to a higher go target is she can't keep resetting, RA, Rama nieth and plenty of others, are all good to be used for clean up, while nieth can be used as a engage from the stun too. 

Then there plenty of gods who want to pop there ults mid fight. 

 if you read a ult and think about it with about it with abit logic you can normally figure out how the ult is best used in a fight"

Now while most humans don't breed like rabbits or continue to produce young throughout their life, we can observe the same pattern of exponential growth. Let's assume every breeding pair of humans brought another human into the world every 20 years. Assuming those offspring also became breeding pairs (hopefully with other family's offspring), in 40 years the population has increased even faster because those new breeding oairs are also producing offspring alongside the past generation."

"I just watched this story for the first time last night. It's a fairly good story.  


My main gripe with it is that the main cast, The Doctor, Polly and Ben, are pushed to the side and don't get to do much for most of the story, particularly Hartnell, but it's understandable with his condition at this time. We spend most of the time with a shouting general and a bunch of scientists who didn't grip me enough. The Cybermen are fantastically creepy and by far my favorite version of the Cybermen of those that I have seen, both in concept and design. Though Hartnell was on the sidelines for most of this story he got some great moments, such as the classic ""Love, pride, hate, fear... Have you no emotions sir"", and his his triumphant return at the start of part 4 and the ensuing confrontation is fantastic.  


Part 4 is by far my favorite episode of this serial and its a damn shame we no longer have the full episode. It's also a shame that Moffat ret-conned the first doctor's last line to ""Here we go, the long way 'round"", where ""Stay warm"" was a fittingly humble last line for such a humble incarnation."

"I guess another story I have (shorter) was my science teacher in 7th grade. Taught bio. He was hilarious and crazy. Told all these crazy stories like how he was born with webbed feet and stepped on a rake. Another story was that he had a parasitic infection when he went to Mexico by drinking the water and compared the illness like giving birth; his sister made fun of him through his pain. Lastly was that he was gifted tamales and he ended up eating them but not unwrapping them.

He also prevented me from committing suicide. For a while I contemplated on overdosing on pills. 

I was severely bullied in middle school and I eventually broke down at the end of class when my bullies started messing with me in the hall. He walks out the hall (the bullies left) and accompanied me to the AP’s office. I tried to tell him everything was ok; he got pissed and said that he knew that things weren’t. “I’m taking you to the AP.” I was honestly just afraid the bullying would get worse; he told me that if anyone tried to make things worse, he’d do everything to make sure that none of that ever happens. I told him I didn’t want him to be late for class, he said that the class could wait because he wouldn’t tolerate one of his kids being treated this way. He waited patiently in the waiting area as I talked to the AP about things. Took about 15min. He even was so kind as to escort me to my class and carry my bag. Over the next few days he’d ask me how I was doing and offered advice etc.

"It's completely fair and honest to say that Labor projects it will raise more taxes based on their announced policies.  As long as you tell the whole truth.  And that is that the coalition has legislated tax and benefit changes that were not announced.

It's hypocritical (wrong) to describe claim your own tax increases as ""Without Increasing Taxes"", and to describe your opponents changes to loop holes and deductions as new taxes.

It's also hypocritical to complain that Labor's changes to franking affects people who have already planned with them in place, when you just changed the taper rate on the aged pension.

"I try the most recent practicable start point (i.e if the most recent is the third of a set of episodes on a particular theme, I’ll start with the first). If I like that, I’ll go back to the beginning.

I won’t necessarily listen to every past episode (I’m more prone to skipping episodes in anthology type shows, where the episode topic doesn’t interest me) but I will usually listen to most. Only once I’ve caught up do I subscribe, so there’s no episodes hanging around in my podcast player for too long. Once I’ve subscribed to a podcast, I add it to my ‘unplayed’ podcast, which is where I start a listening session.

As a side note, I’ll often download that recent episode to sample several weeks before I actually get to it and will have several sampler episodes waiting for me to finish my most recent new show. I just find it easier to keep track of the ones that have been recommended to me if they’re already in the podcast app."

"If you have two alkanes (one being branched and the other being unbranched), then neither would associate with the polar stationary phase. The unbranched alkane would associate with the nonpolar mobile phase gas via van der Waals interactions to a larger degree than the branched alkane, and as a result the unbranched alkane would elute first.

van der Waals forces are dependent on the surface area of two compounds -- branching decreases the ability for two nonpolar compounds to engage in intermolecular forces."

So you're saying management can actually control the degree or percentage of warmth or humidity of the air? Like through changing the percentage of coolant or something?

"Question:   What is a Witch and can we prove they exist in some parallel with the Bible?

The comment above this one is basically proof of Witches when someone takes it in context.  Wiccans would be ""Neo-Pagan"" Witchcraft?

Are Witches real?  Wiccans believe they are, and the US Government has allowed them to be a religion.

A Witch was known as a ""Concubine of Satan.""  Rasputin was part of a heresy that believed in engaging in mortal sin towards feeling God's forgiveness.  Rasputin liked Prostitutes.  He also prostituted married women and noble women around Russia.  He had access to the Royal Family.  Someone gave him authority?  He have primary documentation and proof of a lot of what he was doing?

I have been aware of some Witches.  The ones I have been aware of have been through about a mile of phallus, they engaged in debauchery, and someone them had multiple children from multiple men.

There are Witches capitol ""W"" that may have casted spells.  There are witches, lower case, that may have been in sin, and ended up with the wrong person and caught something.  They have some spirit?  What spirit are they of?  Their body was a vessel?  A vessel for what?

To your checklist: I would love to hear your explanation for how it's so much easier, and yet, yards per completion DECREASED. I know you won't understand this, but I'll explain with actual statistics, something you've yet to do at all. 

From 2008 to 2018, yards per attempt increased 0.4 yards while yards per completion decreased 0.1 yards. What does that tell you? That means that 2018 QBs are opting more for short, high-percentage throws than the long bomb. It's the only explanation for completion percentage increasing while yards per completion decreases. There is no other explanation. So, if QBs are choosing to throw short more often than 10 years ago, what does that tell you about the passing atmosphere? It certainly can't be significantly easier, otherwise QBs would be airing it out more and we'd see an increase in yards per completion. It can only be comparable in ease to 2008 or more difficult. The stats lean more to the former as most efficiency stats are comparable and even quantity stats are in the same realm when scaled for the 8% uptick in PAs.

\-Five stars for the five 'collar counties'

\-Six-pointed stars to maintain continuity with Chicago's flag

\-Circular sector to represent The Loop

\-Filled-in circle and lines into it for the Chicago river

\-Strip out the yellow of the Cook County flag to form a more cohesive look, and bring it more in line with Chicago's flag colors

A one man wrecking crew just running around not giving a single f@%# while warriors had to deal with stuns, kiting that allowed their burst. 

Sorry you sucked at the game. It's why you cried about balance, just like every bad player has in every GOOD MMO ever made. Perfect balance is impossible in a MMO unless you are all playing the same class and dumb them all down to the lowest common denominator. This is exactly what you have in modern WoW."

"Was gonna say Mark Hamill too. Anything where he voices The Joker is something I have to watch. He voiced The Joker in the Batman Arkham Knight PS4 game too and was great!

Jason Marsden is also fantastic too. He does a lot of “quirky, teenage guy” roles. My favorites from him are Impulse from the show Young Justice and Max Goof from the Goofy Movies back in the late ‘90s-early 2000s.

Yuri Lowenthal’s another one. I know he voiced Ben Ten, but my favorite from him hands down has got to be his work as Peter Parker/Spiderman in the current Spiderman PS4 game. That game is just my favorite video game of all time in general.

"The PS handhelds have always been under utilized in one way or another. I think the PSP had games that flexed the systems capabilities as much as possible, not having a second joystick really limited that systems games, so that system was simply not recognized much for its potential by buyers themselves.

Whereas the Vita had a lack of developers really trying, it seems. Its a pretty good indie machine and a great portable emulator machine when you hack it, but Vita exclusive games other than Gravity Rush (which was ported later) and like...Tearaway just didn't have enough to grab people. GR and Tearaway are fantastic games. Persona is too niche, Uncharted is just Uncharted, Mercenary runs too slow to be taken seriously, some of the ports like Jak and Daxter run like absolute shit. Plenty of good indies but most people owned them already."

Start with wedges to loosen up and confirm my distances at 1/2, 3/4, and full swings with them. Try some ole floppy flops aimed at the 25yd marker.

Move back to wedges and shorter irons for target practice at the ""greens"" we have.

Move to my hybrid out of the rough... our range was once a cattle pasture, so we have some rough patches to hit out of. 

Move to some long irons to work on accuracy with them

""It is an intriguing time. When kingdoms fell in every direction, the Reach prospered."" Adrian managed to catch up with Victoria, picking up a small book from the table that contained the layout of the library and the position of the other books. He then followed a trail of bookshelves and returned moments later, with a big book in his hands. It was full of dust, and most of the letters in the cover were barely noticeable. ""The Three Sage Kings. Three Gardener kings that instead of fighting the invaders, chose to accept part of their culture and assimilate them into their realm. The Andals gave the Reach their advanced knowledge and protection for further invaders, and the Gardeners adopted their faith and gave them lands. This book does a good job on portraying the time, going through three generations. It also marks the beggining of House Tyrell as simple andal knights under the service of the Gardeners.

"**Please** stop spreading this myth! Changing your MTU **does not** lower online lag, it could make things worse for both players. It's a myth that started immediately after Ultimate's release, and I thought everyone knew it was debunked. /u/CrowleyMC please change your settings back to normal.

**The facts:** changing the MTU to 1500 might improve download speed (as in downloading games/content) but 1400 is definitely better at preventing packet loss, which is the cause of lag. Not download speed.

1500 is common in some hardware because that’s the max MTU for Ethernet. However, that’s the max MTU including headers, including the Ethernet, IP, and UDP headers. 1400 is the common MTU value when it doesn’t include the headers, as that’s a safe value to go with. Start increasing the MTU too much, and you’ll start encountering packet fragmentation, which will only make packer loss worse. There is a way you can test your ISP connection to find *your* optimal MTU, but if you don't know what any of this means then you definitely shouldn't be changing it; it's set to 1400 by default for a very good reason, and you might make your online gameplay less stable.

Op, if you definitely can't run a wire across your home from your router (the best solution), the next best thing would be a powerline/powerwall product, which sends Ethernet over your homes wall outlets. Some home with is less suitable so do some quick research before you buy."

"The scene where the corrupted side character tries to kill the MC.  It's when the climax intensifies, it's when the MC's faith is tested, and it's when many character arcs develop or end.

However, originally throughout the novel I planned for the corrupted character to be slain by another side character who was a coward throughout the story.  For plot reasons, he sacrifices himself to save the MC and kill the corrupted character.  They both fall to their death, and the MC is sad.

Once I got to the scene, everything I thought I wanted to do changed.  Now im wondering if it's better to have the corrupted character kill himself as a last act of heroism.

I wrote in the original version because it completes two arcs but it still makes corrupted dude's arc kinda... incomplete?  Was a good guy, dies a villain without a moment to redeem himself.  I don't know.  I focus more on the side character that saves the day so we will see.  He's the more relatable one and gives a speech not to give up.  I might change it, we will see."

"The smallest black box is a digital to analogue converter. Takes audio over USB and turns it in to a listenable signal. It is fed to the smaller silver box, my pre amplifier. This is really a headphone amplifier made by Schiit Audio, which I use for headphones normally. However, it has RCA outputs in the back, so it can be used as a preamplifier. 

Preamplifiers handle taking the input source which is a lower level signal and allow volume adjustment before it hits the giant black box, a two channel power amp. Real preamps act like receivers in that they have lots of inputs and the ability to switch. The power amp is “dumb”, and is like the output section of any AV receiver. It just takes the incoming signal and turns it in to current to drive speakers. I’m no electrical engineer, but that’s some sense of how it works."

"CC only offer lower division classes. And it better to worry more on the lower division than the upper division since the upper division are more difficult.

Just worry about the lower division and your general classes at the moment."
"First to be clear on terminology. Physical observables are invariant under gauge transformations. There are auxiliary quantities which do transform under gauge transformations. For these quantities you are free to choose gauge fixing conditions. Examples of gauge fixing conditions are the Coulomb gauge fix and the Lorenz gauge fix. 

Then to your questions. Any choice of gauge fix is valid, it doesn't need to be justified, since it doesn't change the value of physical observables. The only motivation for choosing a certain gauge fix is to simplify calculations. At the end of the calculation, you need to make sure the end result is gauge invariant, i.e. does not depend on the choice of gauge fix."

"But if you do that then you need to keep the ""And after"" part faily short. Like a 30pages something chapter relating or hinting how the situation went sour after the defeat of the WW. Otherwise, you take the risk of undermining you own story. Take the example of ""The Scouring of the Shire"". LOTR was all about how evil (war) pervert and transform everything that it touch. So, when evil has finally been defeated, Tolkien had this chapter were we learned that the Shire was now under occupation and was almost completely destroyed. Yeah, the bad guys had been defeated, but the world wasn't the same anymore. Everything had change.

Martin already said that he was aiming for a similar ending with AOIAF. So it's entirely possible that after the ""death"" of the NK there is one chapter describing the aftermath (maybe showing us Dany 1 years later who had now become a despot or something along those lines). An other possibility lie in the fact that in the books the NK is not a single entity. It's rather an ethereal force. So it's possible that the ending will be something hinting at the comeback of the WW in the future. Stating by this the fact that humanity will never be truly safe and we always need to find need way to collaborate in order to survive."

I've asked him before if you stole a bottle of wine from the store and I stole a bag of chips, which one is worse? They are both stealing, they are both misdemeanors, does it really matter which is more expensive on the moral side of things? He has said before that things aren't even the same and Trump should be allowed to work work Russia because the FBI and Obama spied on his campaign. I asked him again, so if Trump was being watched by the FBI because of illegal activity, that would bother you? He says no. But if Hillary was being watched, then that is fine? He always says yes because we all know Hillary is crooked and is a liar. That's literally his argument for anything. My team is good, other team is bad."

"The Orb of Vaermina, and plot armour.

But it was actually a military stalemate, albeit a Thalmor strategic victory. 

From what I remember, lots of Imperial forces weren’t engaged and the Empire was beating back the Thalmor before the end of the war, the latter only being able to push through so many lands because the Empire was caught in a surprise, it’s armies in Cyrodiil were constantly out-maneuvered by Thalmor General Lord Narfil, who used the Orb of Vaermina to predict Imperial Legion movements, and because the Empire was in decline since the rise of the Mede emperors. Only High Rock, Cyrodiil and Skyrim remained prosperous, Hammerfell and Morrowing had become a burden, the former due to internal conflicts, and the latter due to the Red Mountain disaster, and the other provinces seceded.

However, not even this would be able to defeat the Empire. Redguard/Nord warriors, Imperial commanders and High Rock mages, along with the strategic advantage they held from fighting within their homeland, specially in Hammerfell, instead of having to finance an expedition in lands full of attrition, would definitely be more of a match for the Thalmor un-soldiery army, with no client countries of great military prominence, except the Summerset Isles in naval combat. And it’s also important to remember, that as Elder Scrolls Legends implies, most Thalmor armies were composed of High Elf soldiery, so the Bosmer archers / Khajit rogues wouldn’t be as bug a factor as the other races were in the Empire.

So much so, that in 4E 174 the Thalmor had to gamble their entire army in a campaign in Cyrodiil, while the Imperials still had fresh troops in Skyrim and High Rock, and battle-tested and still formidable legions and paramilitary forces in Hammerfell &amp; Cyrodiil. The campaign was successful for some time, and the Thalmor expected the Emperor Titus to sue for peace, and he often pretended he was about to start negotiations, but in truth the Imperials were gathering more troops to retake the Imperial City, which they soon would, after which they would destroy the main Thalmor army in Cyrodiil.

The Thalmor also had an expedition in Hammerfell, which had initial sucess and managed to cross the Alik’r desert and capture Skaven, but was ultimately defeated by legionnaire “invalids” (which were actually battle-hardened veterans) and united Crown-Forebear warriors.

Here comes the part which seems far-fetched in the plot to me, the Imperials, despite now having the upper hand (and as the Redguard showed later, being easily able to repulse the Thalmor from their lands), decided to sign the White-Gold Concordant, giving the Thalmor the strategic victory they wanted.

Not sure if my old knowledge of the Great War holds up, but I hope I helped."

"I totally agree, but it’s one thing to change reality and another thing to mess with the difficulty of an encounter mid-combat just to fit your side of the battle.

The player obviously doesn’t get to decide what the owlbear can and can’t do, but flying is a *huge* advantage in combat, especially considering that owlbears are capable of grappling their opponents (at least in Pathfinder). It could drastically improve their ability to hunt the players should they run away, too. If your owlbear flies, it might be worth considering raising the CR (templates usually do so).

That said, assuming it wasn’t a custom-made monster, the players can be right too. It’s bad practice as a GM to just tell the players “no, you’re wrong” every time an issue comes up, especially if you didn’t know better. It’s a cooperative game, if you’re not trying to kill your players then what’s the point of ignoring the rules?

That said, I don’t know your game or the situation or the players. I don’t know if the player identified the monster or purely metagamed it. I’m certainly not saying you were in the wrong, but I couldn’t say that your player was either, I’m just saying that there’s a reason owlbears don’t fly and it’s okay to be wrong as a GM."

"I don't have problems with sloops, just solo sloops. 2 man sloops can still pose a real threat in ship engagements. I wouldn't be entirely opposed to a sloop only server set so I only get paired with brigs and galleons, but my fear is that too many people would view the sloop only servers as a low risk option leaving the big ship servers empty. 


What I really want is Rare to stop catering to solo sloops and do more to encourage crews. A good first step would be matchmaking options. Most solo sloopers just don't have friends that play the game, and open crew is terrible since there's so much to do in the game. You should be able to place checkmark next to each faction and other things like forts, then it only matchmakes people who all have a common box checked."

"Your comment inspired me to look up details on the fuel usage of cargo ships, and while they do burn an enormous amount of fuel, they are actually significantly more fuel efficient other modes of transportation.  

The fact that there are 90,000 cargo ships out there and their massive fuel expenditure is a result of the quantities of goods being shipped. Cut demand, cut fuel usage. 

This seems like a situation where changing habits to purchase fewer new imported goods could directly reduce the amount of fuel being burned by cargo ships."

"Please read *The Virgin's Promise* by Kim Hudson for an explanation of the type of unflawed character you are describing. It's a different type of storytelling than *The Hero's Journey* (and has nothing to do with literal virgins).

Some examples of these types of stories are: Cinderella, Billy Elliot, and Legally Blonde. Think about it. What flaws do these characters possess? Their main problem is that they are controlled by external forces, and they must overcome these and step into their own power. They don't need to change. The people around them do.

I just watched Captain Marvel yesterday and loved it. I can't think of any flaw she had, other than being controlled/manipulated by others. She is *told* over and over that she's ""too emotional""... but the people telling her that are WRONG. When she stops listening to them and embraces who she is, she becomes powerful. She has to throw off external control to truly become powerful.

The ""Virgin"" archetype doesn't work and train to overcome a flaw the way the ""Hero"" does. She (it's usually a she) works to liberate herself and bring order to her kingdom/world/universe."

"Should I withdraw?

Hello, I am in a situation I don't find pleasing and I'm a bit conflicted on how to.act.

Backstory: this is the 1st week of 7 week accelerated courses, I am currently taking 2 of them, both online mind you. Taking financial accounting and management information systems. I, since Monday, have spend 7 hours daily on this accounting course, haven't finished half of the weekly assignments, struggled really hard on the assignments, and at .my current rate won't finish my assignments.till Thursday, leaving only 3 days for the other course.

I get it, it's literally only day 2 of the semester, but I have never felt this overwhelmed. I've taken online accelerated courses before, 200 level courses that are easier than this 100.pevel course, but it's causing.me a.lot of stress.

If I withdraw before Sunday, I'll get half.my.money back, anything. later and nothing. I just feel burnout and I feel as though unlike any semester ever, I've taken, I'll ha e to work morning to night just to stay on track, barely any time to digest the information. I'm just miserable a d struggling, I'm not sure if I can bunker out this level of work and time. 

I'm contemplating withdrawing for the first time, but I just don't know. What do you guys think? I think I'll see how it is until Sunday and then decide, but I'll see if I can mentally handle that. It's also be first withdrawal and I'm transferring to a uni in the Fall, so it would slightly delay graduation, which sucks, but better than facing hell.

TLDR: miserably day 2 online e accelerated course, withdraw or no? Or wait till Sunday to get half.refund?"

"Along those lines, if you *want* to be around 55% allocated into fixed income, then why not shift a bunch of that into a traditional fixed income holding like a bond fund? It's not guaranteed like a 2.3%+ HISA or higher (let's say redeemable) GIC, but it gives you a chance at higher returns with a much, much lower potential downside than equities.

If you're going to hold a lot of cash, though, I hope it's at least in a decent 2%+ HISA (I missed whether you already mentioned you're doing this)."

"This is tricky because on one hand, you're right. We as a society should have some kind of say in how children are raised and what that means for us. That's where we have abuse and neglect laws and protections for kids to help them. Your kid has to attend school, eat food, and on and on.

But on the other hand, it's not difficult to see why people are generally going to be wary of the government shoving them and telling them what to do. If I'm diagnosed with NPD and I've gone through counseling, does that diagnoses alone mean I shouldn't be allowed to have children? How do you know I'm an unfit parent if you don't know what kind of parent I am?

That's where this comes in. We could spend all day looking at statistics and trying to track down the vectors of society that are most likely to abuse children but...that falls apart on the individual level. People change, circumstances change, perfectly healthy people have mental breakdowns when they have kids and suddenly become unfit. People who were previous self-centered and lacked empathy develop it when they see their own child.

We have to balance freedom and harm, and I think in this case what is really needed is clear avenues for children and their caretakers (teachers, the other parent, other adults) to report abusive behaviors and an increased public awareness about what emotion and physical abuse looks like.

People who abuse children should not have the right to raise their children. But we need to be careful about how we go about stripping people of their basic rights. I personally am a little wary of this kind of ""pre-crime"" look at a section of society that tends to be hurt pretty bad by policies on the regular, people who suffer problems with mental health.

It's tricky, and I honestly do not mean to downplay the abuse anyone experienced as a child raised by someone with a mental health issue. I know that wasn't easy, and I'm not going to sit here and say ""well there's nothing that could have been done!"" I just think we need to be very careful about how we evaluate what is happening and how we move forward on these kinds of questions."

"Because there's no reason to accept it.

The film is just a different continuity, and that's okay. In my mind the events of the film still roughly happened for our characters in SG-1, just slightly differently.

If you try and create these kinds of link it starts to make decisions about the lore that is not up to us. You would have to decide that a Goa'uld can use an Asgard as a host, and that one would prefer that to a Tau'ri, and that somehow he would put a human skin around the Asgard.

Then you have to make up a plethora of excuses as to why so many other things are different, like Creek Mountain/Cheyenne Mountain, 1994/1996, different names, etc.

There's a reason why there are so many differences. The SG-1 showrunners want you to know that it's a different continuity."

Suggest she talk to a psychologist this is a repressed form of communication. Something instilled deep in her from when she was a child that when she acts like that she can get her way. She may have since learned that’s not how life works but the way our parents/caregivers attend to us when we are little creates deep neurological pathways.

"I was told about this just recently by my friend. She said they taste like dirt. Now when her office buys the bags of assorted mini-candy bars, they would go through, pick out the 'new and improved' butterfingers and throw them away.

"I honestly think this should be a monthly PSA for all the drivers (and pedestrians, at that) moving here.  There's zero requirement for people to learn local traffic laws when moving to Washington, and that law in particular is extremely key both to keeping traffic going (avoiding the whole ""You go..."" ""No *you* go!"" right-of-way standoff we're famous for) and simply keeping people safe, since our pedestrians are very used to confidently stepping out into the road and out-of-state drivers are very used to not having pedestrians do that outside of a marked sidewalk (e.g. one car stops, knowing the rules, and the car that doesn't gets impatient and zips around them, or just keeps going in the next lane over)."

"And companies that grow meat substitutes, make electric cars, make solar panels etc etc etc all invest in what advertising that makes them money. That is not inherently less evil. Fake meats could cause lymphoma 20 years down the line, legalized weed touts health miracles....but there's virtually no long term research for that (Most of the long term studies are coming to a close....and they're not all sunshine and rainbows)...the weed industry will tell you otherwise.

Cattle is not inherently dangerous for the environment. There used to be almost 90 million buffalo, large herding animals are necessary for the environment.  It's how we ranch that can be harmful. And ranching practices are changing rapidly. But if you listen to people pushing meat replacements....cattle bad, fake meat good...Period. Just look at AOC....completely replace our beef industry with fake meat farms. Yeah, okay.

"Elder abuse is so so so common. It's just that we don't hear about it a lot because the victims often aren't of very sound mind or body and so aren't able to defend themselves or speak up for themselves. The most common type of abuse is financial, in which the abuser manipulates the elder person to give them money or even alter their will. There are also many cases of physical abuse involving caretakers. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you live in the US, know that there are resources out there for you to report elder abuse on behalf of someone else! You do not have to be an immediate family member. You could just be a neighbor or friend and still report it. These laws vary state by state, but here is the HHS website which is a good start.  [https://www.hhs.gov/answers/programs-for-families-and-children/how-do-i-report-elder-abuse/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/programs-for-families-and-children/how-do-i-report-elder-abuse/index.html)

My Aunt is my Grandmother's primary caretaker, and it is really sad because she basically has to guard my Grandma from the other kids/grandkids/cousins because they only come around whenever they need money. Half of the family wants what is best for her, the other half can't wait till she is dead so that they can start picking apart her stuff. And she doesn't even have that much money or any really valuable things; they just all think they own the place because ""we're family"". I painted her a picture for Christmas and the first thing she said was ""Can you put it way high there (and pointed to a really hard to get to spot above the entertainment center) so that no one will mess with it?"""

"Of course their would be an appeal, that's how defense rolls when you've taken the 5th from the beginning. If they can't stop the charges and conviction, the last step is to minimise the sentance.

In my uneducated opinion, the depraved mind context of the 3rd degree murder conviction is justifiable.

At the time, the MPD had been warning officers of cop killing ambushes. But as far as I've read, there was no policy or training put in place to mitigate that risk. So you end up with an officer on the frontline with a depraved mind because of the paranoia being fed by the command structure."
"“Jenny, come downstairs, quick! There’s a letter from Stanford in the mail!”

Jenny’s feet barely touched the carpeted stairs as she flew down from her room. Stanford was her dream. When her kindergarten classmates had said, all those years ago, that they wanted to be athletes or movie stars or dinosaurs when they grew up, Jenny had said that she wanted to be a scientist. When the time came to visit colleges, Stanford was a natural choice, and she had fallen in love as soon as she set foot on campus.

Jenny almost collided with her father when she reached the bottom of the stairs. The pair shared a laugh, not unlike the many other laughs the pair had shared over the years. Once they had recovered, Jenny’s father handed her the envelope.

She could feel her heart in her throat when she saw that the envelope was an ordinary #10 envelope. Her friends at school had told her that when colleges send out acceptances, they get sent in big, grandiose envelopes, while the rejections get sent in smaller ones. She had no idea if this was true, but it was the first time she had entertained the idea that she might not get into Stanford.

After a brief pause that felt like an eternity, Jenny tore open the envelope and pulled out the letter. Her nerves gave way to grief as she read the short note. She had worked so hard, she had poured her life into her dream, and now she was holding the end of that dream in her hands.

Jenny gave the letter back to her father without a word and ascended the stairs, returning to her room. Once she was gone, he read the letter, but he already knew from her reaction what it said. He had just finished reading when a knock at the front door caught his attention.

A few minutes later, Jenny was curled up on her bed when she heard her bedroom door open. Jenny wiped the tears from her eyes as well as she could before turning to the door. Her father was here to comfort her, no doubt, and she didn’t want him to see her like this. She was tough, and she could handle it.

When she finally did compose herself and turn around, her father broke the silence.

“Mr. Ramirez from next door just stopped by. The mailman accidentally gave him a piece of mail that belongs to us. Actually, it belongs to you.”

Despite her best efforts to remain stoic, tears and a quivering smile broke through as she looked at her father, who was holding an envelope emblazoned with California, Berkeley’s seal.

A big, grandiose envelope."

"Magic is fun and all, it’s enough to get you interested, but none of that stuff is why Harry Potter is so loved. What makes the series stand out are the characters and the story. How Harry struggles and grows through his experiences, with an emphasis on the help he is given by people who love him. Themes are woven beautifully into the plot, and expressed in highly engaging dialogue among the vivid array of characters, each of whom is admirable yet flawed—you can relate to them. That’s good drama."

"It's just not the pitches. It's the smaller boundaries, two hard balls that don't swing much - also less chance of reverse too now, and 5 fielders are only allowed the inner circle for the last 10 overs.

If these scores are chased down they're chased down for the loss of 8 to 9 wickets and chased in the last over."

Quite fond of Ch11.
"It depends on why you aren't as happy as you could be.  Are you an audiophile who's constantly irritated by the shit sound quality of your cheap headphones?  Then money *will* buy you a degree of happiness, in the form of better headphones.

But for some people, it's not so much that they lack the means to be happy, but that they have other problems in their life that are precluding them from being happy.  Maybe you dream of being a great writer whose books inspire a whole generation, but you're an alcoholic who can't kick the booze long enough to get any writing done, so all you have to show for your efforts is a bunch of drunken rambling drivel.  Just buying yourself that new sports car you wanted isn't going to improve the underlying situation, it just distracts you from it for a bit.

So if your problem is a lack of *good* things in your life, then more money probably does buy more happiness.  But if your problem is too many *bad* things weighing you down and keeping you from being happy, you can't just drown out the bad by outspending it.  Happiness isn't some bank balance spread sheet where you tally up the good and the bad and arrive at a net sum, some of the bad things trump everything else and make you unhappy no matter how much good stuff you buy for yourself to compensate, you have to actually fix what's wrong before you can truly be happy."
"Not trash tier, but a lot of Matchups got worse then they already were."
"I don't know, do you think every minor the left uses writes all their own stuff ? I do know there are lots of things I didn't write that I agree with. My whole issue is with the tech socialists cyber '""disappearing"" those that say things **they disagree with**. History is full of millions of people ""disappeared"" by socialists in real life just as soon as they get power. They are clearly demonstrating that it isn't just Alex Jones, its me, you, little girls, anyone that dares to say anything they don't like. You will obey, or you will cease to exist. These are the kind of people will kill millions in real life if they get power, and they are getting more powerful everyday. That should scare you, and I'm serious when I tell you that."
Gotta know your market.
"It came out he likes to sexually assault straight men. A former classmate of his revealed that he's been doing it since high school. He responded to the classmate by basically admitting it was true, then telling her to take it down and admit she lied or his lawyers would sue."
Amazingly fucking sexy
"Hey! It’s my birthday, too! So I just popped in to say, “Happy Birthday!” And congratulations on passing your exams. 

But while I’m here, you’re NTA. I don’t think this is so much about gifts as it is about wanting your family to show that they appreciate and care about you. I’m getting the sense that there is quite a bit of imbalance in your relationship with your family, as in you’re spending a lot of your time and energy helping them, on top of going to school and working, and your family can barely be bothered to make the bare minimum of efforts for your birthday. 

This kind of dynamic isn’t sustainable and inevitably leads to massive resentment on the part of the “giver” (as opposed to the “taker”). It’s ok to take a step back from your role as the family caregiver and learn to prioritize your needs and well being. It sounds like you have *a lot* on your plate, and I’m sure you’re exhausted and burnt out and could really use a break. So take one."
"Being that you're 16 and more likely than not have very little driving experience, id tell you not to get either of those cars. The WRX is probably a little bit safer as you're more likely to understeer on throttle, but I wouldn't recommend a bugeye as a first car. Your budget also means you'd get one that's likely beaten to shit, so I might suggest a different path. How do you feel about a FocusST or an old Mazdaspeed3? Both are FWD, which is easier to control when you have no experience, have plenty of torque, look sporty, and have enough power to get you in trouble in a straight line. If you wanted to learn how to drive RWD, I'd start with something less powerful, like a BRZ or an old BMW."
"Really liked this track! Mixing and production wise I think it sounds great. Sub Bass and other volumes seem fine to me. I think there's still some room to make the track more interesting. Try changing up the transitions between phrases. I like the sound that comes in at 1:37 but the melody it's playing is kinda boring. Same thing with the main pluck that comes in at the breakdown. Personally, I would change up the actual notes the melody is playing at the breakdown as it almost sounds like it's in a different key or something. Something else you could try, is to add more random percs or add effects here and there, like a delay or something, to make the drums more interesting.

Overall really cool sounding track. All of the sounds work together really well."

"“75 percent cellulose nanocrystals from wood pulp”

If this was produced at the level required to eliminate styrofoam, how much wood would we need to harvest every year? Can it be made out of recycled wood products? What is the process used to convert old materials into usable pulp?

I love these stories, I hope it works and is adopted! I just always wonder about what it would take to really take over an existing industry. What are the unintended consequences or upstream/downstream affects of the new method?"

"This exactly. Also, in the long term you want to measure if there is a correlation between a decrease in sugary drinks and an increase in other metrics that measure “health” in general, such as obesity rates, heart disease, etc. Like you mentioned, if people just got their sugar from other sources, it’s not really an effective health initiative, and maybe just boosts some revenue for the city."
"That sounds really hard, and I don't think its surprising that its rough on you. Logically, the odds of your relationship surviving this year are probably significantly better because she is poly, if that thought helps at all. Her meeting someone else while you're away doesn't mean the end of her and you. She doesn't have to choose between a year of no emotional or physical connection nearby and waiting for you to get better. Her other relationships aren't at odds with her love for you. I think you may already know that though. What it sounds like you're mostly feeling is envy, along with valid fears about how your relationship will come out the other side of your recovery. I don't know that you ""fix"" that, so much as just feel it. 

Are there any poly groups where you are? If nothing else some poly friends to vent to would probably be good."

"R Scott Bakker, Though I wouldn't argue that hes not doing Game of Thrones but rather evolving the formula that Game of Thrones worked in. Like Game of Thrones it takes place in a dark, gritty, political setting that alludes to a specific real world time period while following multiple pov characters from various outlooks. Its not a new formula but GoT arguable defined it and set the bar for the last couple of decades. R Scott Bakker, however surpasses Martin few ways in my opinion. The Prince of Nothing is more complex in both its world building and thematic underpinnings, specifically he delves very deeply into the various religions and their metaphysical bases. I would argue that his history is also more interesting than Got. Its mythological heavy as opposed to the more military style history of Got, I feel that its more fitting for the setting but that's up for debate. In general though one of Bakkker's strong points is his ability to put the reader the perspective of his weird and foreign (to the modern mindset) characters.

Toronto does not have a better package than we do (more youth, picks). Boston does, but we offer a better gamble looking into the future.

"1. This is just what I’ve learned and read. STDs through oral sex would be noticeable. You know herpes, obviously. IF you have a bacterial STD in the mouth, you would have a sore throat. Again, that’s IF. It’s less likely that you would get it orally. I’m not a doctor but I really think you’re okay. 

2. Just casually say, “hey I think we should get STD tested before we do anything. not because i think you or I have anything, just to be safe!” If anyone has an issue with that, they aren’t mature enough to be in a sexual relationship. Someone can swear they’re clean because they don’t have any symptoms and you can never be too careful! You can explain that as well. 

Best of luck :)"

"Yes, and this is coming from a heavy, heavy meat-eater. I know my consumption contributes to a larger problem. 

I attempt to address that by buying meat locally, from more environmentally-minded places and that additionally puts me in the arena of meat that claims to use less additives, steroids, or preservatives. (this is the health part)

In that sense, my consumption is hopefully more health-conscious than buying simply from the biggest supermarkets. 

Obviously reducing meat intake would also help, and that’s the reason my wife and kid have also decided to be vegetarian. I now eat vegetarian meals more often than not. 

So if I had to pay taxes on my now-reduced meat diet, I would have zero opposition to it."

"Buffon was never forced out, he wanted to leave. Marchisio wanted more playing time and was willing to move to find it, and the club acquiesced by agreeing to a mutual termination which facilitated his move instead of holding out for a transfer fee.

"Are you interested in desserts at all? The majority of fruits are going to have a lot of sugar that's going to be hard to combat, especially if you're using a large amount of it. Obviously citrus is a go-to in cooking, and even the different types of citrus impact those flavors. Orange chicken, lemon butter sauce, tequila lime marinade, to name a few.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand the flavor profile of the fruit as a whole, know its water content, as well as the amount of sugar in it. You could very easily use reduced down fruit with onions to create a sweet and savory sauce. Apples are pretty frequently used in dishes to give a nice bite/tartness, especially paired with pork. Are you just trying to figure out ways to use fruit you purchased to eat on its own that's about to go bad?"

"Vince was definitely building up Steamboat to be the number 2 babyface behind Hulk Hogan. It was clear Ricky had a ton of momentum heading into Wrestlemania 3. I think they were originally going to let Ricky have the IC title for about 1-year too. The thing that gets interesting is, what happens when Ultimate Warrior starts to get his push? And when the WWF finally turned Macho Man to a babyface, where would Steamboat fit into that picture? 

Ultimately, Steamboat had the better career in the NWA and WCW. But it is neat to think about what could have been."

"Also, here is a pit nutter with a criminal justice degree who insinuates the OP provoked the sweet pibble service dog because his friend has one who ""is legit"" lolzies

&amp;#x200B;

by the way, is that all you need to give legal advice over there? lol 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, don't worry pit nutter. your friend's precious pibble is not threatened by this poor man's case. You should be thanking him for his service, not sh\*tting on him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, it's not like fake service pibbles are a thing that everyone talks about because of how often they attack people and other animals.... Maybe college kid should have taken a better look at the Delta case or the Portland Airport case. This could get very messy, and not just for the pitty pibble fake ESA dog owner who can't be bothered to vaccinate HER SERVICE DOG!!!!! Whoops, who needs rabies vaccines anyway? lol /s 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope it's ok. I quoted the comment but didn't link to the sub and didn't specifically name the OP. I didn't respond to them, and neither should ANYBODY else. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;NAL but a Criminal Justice major in Texas with familiarity with ADA law and the penal code.  
&gt;  
&gt;How do you know that the dog was a fake service dog? A friend of mine has a pitbull service dog that is completely legit so the breed alone is not a reason for you to know that the dog is not a real service animal. If the fact that it bit you is what makes you believe that, that is not always the case as any animal could be frightened enough to bite given the right circumstances.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, if you happened to do something to frighten the animal, then that could be on you. If you have forgotten some detail where fault could be on you, then no penalty would come to the owner except for questions regarding the legitimacy of the dog.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As other commenters have said, you don't get to decide whether or not the dog is put down. Especially if the owner has a legitimate disability, there is almost no way for you to confirm the dog's status except for asking for the dogs paperwork showing that it is a service animal. You can't ask what the person's disability is, so if it is for some form of PTSD or social disorder, there would be little to no outward signs of any disability that would require a dog.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, let the police handle the case. If the dog is determined to be not a real service animal, then that status would be removed from the dog. As for putting the dog down, that would be up to animal control, which would work with police on the case. In Texas, there is no defined statute covering the civil liability that an owner faces for damage caused by their animal. Ultimately, Texas follows 2 rules that you need to prove: if the owner knows the dog has been aggressive or has bitten someone in the past, and if the owner was negligent in preventing the bite.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But as I said, it comes down to what the police investigation finds."
It was pretty buggy when it first launched but it's been updated a few times. The reviews also came out before all the updates so that's part of the negativity.
"I agree with almost everything you said but I can’t help but feel like I’m missing something. I don’t see where the wife said exactly how she wanted the stones placed. Was it part of the design? From the OP I got the impression she sent a design and all OP had to do was decide which colors go where. He thought symmetry would be best but his daughter wanted to go by the ages of the kids. I can see how that might have looked awkward but it doesn’t sound like OP saw that. I just don’t see how that makes him an asshole. And I certainly don’t see how that makes the daughter an asshole as a lot of people are saying. 

My beef with the wife is that she expressed that she didn’t like it in front of the kids. Even though I probably would have kept it she had every right to exchange it. That’s perfectly fine. What you don’t do is tell your kids you don’t like their gift. I think OP was justified in being upset about that."

3. Only does reasonable things when convinced or begged to by advisors? Check
4. Sees people as either with her or against her in all matters? Check
5. Has actually murdered innocent people when angry, it is convenient or they're in her way? Check
6. Validly feels paranoid, isolated, and alone? Check

The dog bit her son and the starks are going to get off scot free. It is a bit unfair to kill its sibling but sending the direwolf means no one was punished for mauling her son which makes 0 sense to anyone. If you can just maul joffrey and set your dog free is that okay? What you're suggesting is basically to have the future king get mauled and the starks escape all consequences"

I have heard good things about that ball. I think it is definitely a good choice for a beginner. Another thing I can say it just takes practice and knowing how your equipment works for you.
"Battlesmith seems poorly designed. It needs to use bonus actions for most of its spells and needs to use those same bonus actions for the robopup? Is it supposed to be a frontline fighter or a pet master? It has the features of both but neither of them are fully fleshed out or supported enough. 
If it had ranger style Action to command pet and got Extra Attack at level 5 those issues would be lessened (at level 5 it could case its smite spells and attack and also have its pet attack, thus using all of its archetype features). As it stands you have to choose which half of your archetype to be and neither half gives you anything you wouldn’t be better off refluffing ranger or paladin to do."

I am one of the few people who believes that these classic enthusiasts are a minority group of people overall in WoW, or at least from retail they are. 
Many players who play on the same servers as I do dislike the idea of classic servers, and won't roll on it even if it is for free. They have been paying for a long time because they want new things, not recycled content.  
This, from my perspective, is just a tactic to bring back retired and old players to subscribe again. And yes it will have an impact on the private scene but like I said, it won't render the private scene obsolete."

"The whole early game meta-game is because of last hitting. The fact that your pos 1 carry needs a babysitter - so he can last hit.
1v1 mid - because the lane is short and ganking it is hard so you want to focus the farm and exp on a single hero there.

If last hitting wasn't a thing, the supports and even carry would just go all over the map just trying to get ganks sort of like how HotS works and that would probably make mobile heroes top tier.

You've seriously given no real argument except dismissing everything said to you (by me and other) and now you're just moving goalposts."

- running superkick and spear as it has been for years 

- had a match recently where my opponent just kept pinning me, I would kick out and he would pin again and this kept going for about 10 minutes until I just gave up, pinfalls can't be reversed so if I get knocked down once then gg...

If you don't have any Virtual Step staked you just pay the normal fee of whatever you're trying to execute.

This means that if you don't have enough Step it will still go through and you'll be able to execute but it'll cost ICX instead."

"Great post and also highlights why I get annoyed at people who said Jon’s entire arc was ruined for not personally killing the NK. First of all, if not for Jon, no one would have been even close to the NK, let alone knowing he existed until it was too late.

Second, a huge part of his character and arc is about his identity (crisis), who he is and where he belongs. It’s the central question about himself he can’t get answered and what frustrates him enough to willingly take the black. At winterfell he was Ned Stark’s lowborn bastard. At the wall he is too high born. With the wildlings he’s a crow. Back with the nights watch he’s a wildling lover. He is a stark, ice, and he is a targeryan, Fire. He is simultaneously all these things that make him the odd one out in all the contexts while also being the natural point of gravitation for bringing people together. Through all his time with different groups in different contexts he learns that all people, are just people, regardless at what end of the great hall you’re sitting or what side of the wall you’re on. He is stripped of his entitlements and titles at every step of transformation from group to group. Every time he has to reboot himself and reassess what is the right thing to do for the *people*. He always had empathy but it is enforced in him by continuously being forced to see the situation from the other side. This is what allows him to bring people together and to join his cause for the fight against the long night. He continually says he doesn’t care about titles and renounces them over and over, only to learn he actually has *the* title to rule all titles. These experiences shape him in potentially becoming a ruler of Westeros that can finally move the realm into a new age. Beyond xenophobia, titles, entitlement.

His sense of belonging and identity is absolute central to his story."

"&gt;Why should I support a wall?

I'm not here to tell you why you should support the wall. The point of this thread is to discuss precedents that a Republican president can use against Democrats. 

&gt;I don't think your comparison is fair. Healthcare is essential to living. People die very young without proper healthcare.

This is exactly why we need a president who will use the precedents set buy Democrat presidents against them. Because you guys don't understand that what you believe to be essential is based on your own opinion. I am over 30 and I have never being sick. I don't need someone else forcing me to buy something I know I don't need at this point in my life when they money could be used to further my education and put me in a better position so that I can be able to afford my own healthcare expenses later on in life. 

What you believe is essential is none of my business. Republicans believe a wall is essential to living. As the drugs that flood across the border murders thousands of people yearly. And the criminals who enter murder and rape innocent Americans all the time. If these people were being murdered in your neighborhood do you think you care more about these people being murdered? Do you know what percentage of inmates are illegal immigrants? 

Yes a health work force is best but so is one that consist of people who are not dead and murdered in the streets. So 2 can play that game about what is essential. And no most of the drugs that enter America do not pass through the ports of entry. Who would believe that. The majority of the drugs found by officials are found at the Port of entry. That doesn't mean tons of drugs are not being transported across the border daily that are not being caught. How can you account for the drugs you don't know about? 

&gt; A healthy work force is more productive, and people spend more money when they are healthy. 

This statement is hard to respond to. Think about what you are saying. Why would someone who is going to die not spend money, and what about their healthcare expenses? Why is healthcare#1 cause of bankruptcy? Etc."

For me it's the only drug I'll delve into as I don't particularly like the effects of weed and MDMA/ ecstasy and will never try something as hard as heroin/meth. As whole I've learned that coke is best done in moderation as it can be very morish, we've all been there when we know we should call it a night but haven't.

"Ah, okay. Well, ""seeing"" is what I described - all of the atoms in the wood are absorbing and re-emitting photons (light) back at you. The atoms are so packed together that you can't see the space between them. Keep in mind that the receptors in your eyes are all made up of millions of atoms each, so it's not possible to ""resolve"" down to a single atom. Conversely, objects can be transparent because they they transmit more light (and absorb/re-emit less).

You can ""touch"" objects because of the electromagnetic force. The electrons that make up your hand repel the electrons that make up the plank of wood, preventing them from passing through each other.

I guess this is getting away from the ""explain for laypeople"" rule but I hope it's understandable."

"If you have a massive headache when you quit sugar abruptly, I would really suggest reading into Candida yeast. It lives in your gut and literally feeds on sugar, so when you quit sugar it begins to die off. The toxins it releases can cause headaches, etc.

Regardless, I have had problems with sugar my whole life. Like, guzzling maple syrup from the bottle. No, it's not going to be super easy, but it's not the end of the world either. You need to do some thinking about when and why you eat sugar. Are you eating without thinking? Is there too much of it around you and you're constantly tempted? What triggers you to start eating? Why don't you stop?

Some strategies: don't keep sugar around you. Avoid places you know you are tempted (for me, gas stations and the $1 candy bin at Walmart). Find replacements. Is it a physical thing, like you need to be chewing something? Gum. Gotta be eating? Carrots, almonds, celery, etc. Try practicing mindfulness when you do allow yourself to have a treat, like enjoying the feel of it on your fingers, the smell, the taste, the texture, etc. Try this with a piece of dark chocolate and you might be surprised how much more enjoyable you find it. Honestly, I don't believe in quitting sugar cold turkey. I get so tempted and then I binge, so I plan my treats. I never keep a lot of sugary stuff around my house. My therapist told me that people who are the most motivated don't actually have motivation, they just made it really on themselves to follow through. I'll edit and add other ideas if I think of them.

Anyways, if you wanted to send me a PM maybe we could be accountability buddies or something - I'm really really trying to clean up my sugar intake as well."

"No one said these things. Stop putting words into my mouth and then maybe I wouldn’t be acting like it. No one said it’s a death knell for her life or whatever. Just that she doesn’t get a good ending. This is the same as saying “oh don’t be sad about insert-sad-thing-here, children in Africa have it much worse”. Just cause there are worse things doesn’t mean this isn’t bad 

You’re showing a deep misunderstanding of her journey. She repeatedly prays to be back in Winterfell, married and with children who look like her siblings time and time again. She wants this. I’m not the one acting like she needs it to be happy. She’s the one who repeatedly said she did and wanted it.

"Good news. Being 'doped up' with a gun is a felony. Its already illegal, so you're safe. I wasnt cherry picking anything, the point I was making is that bad people do bad things, with or without guns. I'd love to see the non cherry picked data you're hoarding that shows it 'the other way'. It's just not true. Aside from 3 cities in the US, violence of any kind is nearly nonexistent. Most of the gun crimes happen in 3 cities (weirdly with very strict gun laws) and the stats from those cities are inflated to perpetrate the idea that the US has a gun violence problem. It's really a gang problem in Chicago, not a national problem with guns. And yes, you are afraid of guns or you wouldn't be arguing from your stance."

Title: **Employer wants my girlfriend to work without pay?**

Original Post: 

&gt; To start i couldnt figure out which flair to use cause we are not a union shop but my question contains a labor issue.
&gt; 
&gt; My girlfriend and I work at the same factory and we have an attendance policy that unfortunately she has not been having luck following. We are allowed 15 points and she has 14 and todsy she got a final written warning then was informed she has a 1 day work suspension. How it was described to her is this work suspension is one day she comes to work her full shift but they can decide not to pay her. Now to me that sounds very illegal but obviously i didn't go to lawschool. Can someone explain to me if this is legal or not?

"I have had two kids. I'm 5ft and in my late 30s. My highest weight was 210lbs, my lowest was 110lbs.  I'm currently about 115lbs. I've been between 110 - 117 lbs for about the last 3 years. 

I have found the my loose skin has lessened as I've maintained. It was never that bad to start with though. I definitely still have some, like if I am doing a plank it is there a little bit, but any shirt will hide it, and if I have even mid rise pants on you'd never know it was there at all. Most of my stretch marks are not really visible at all. 

This was me in a bikini last summer http://imgur.com/a/dmKjkqo

And while I don't have a before of the loose skin, here are a few before/after pics for reference of where I started http://imgur.com/a/x4XBwBJ"

"Choosing to make more money out of selfishness is very different from choosing to hurt the planet out of selfishness. 

Working 80 hours only hurts you, but the same can't be said for not going vegan, unnecessarily car commuting, living in more house than you need, etc.

I do all those things you say would make you miserable (except for growing my *all* of own food, but that's just not possible in this modern life), and I think I have a pretty nice life all things considered. Biking and being vegan is healthy, and all those things you mentioned save money. (Activism is a fun hobby too.)

You really should try to changing your behaviour to be less harmful to the planet. It's not as bad as you think.

Edit: just noticed you have a 50 mile commute. (That also isn't eco-friendly.) While I agree you can't bike to work, you'd improve your life by moving close enough to work that you could bike. It'd be a win-win."

The point being made is that *if* a pervasive aspect of society is causing misery and cruelty to be inflicted upon some other people, then no matter how much you think these other people ""deserve it"" the simple reality is that maybe from a ""social stability"" point of view one needs to do something to mitigate misery and cruelty being inflicted upon these other people.

Gripping the M-O feels so similar to my S2 which does have a ledge for my ring finger, and I keep placing my ring finger back up top instead of keeping it on the side which results in a lot of accidental right clicks.

The clicks are nicer than my S2 for sure. Way better for most games, and even shooters that aren't reliant on having well-timed individual clicks."

"When my little sister was born I thought about smothering her all the time, I was only three but I still remember how angry and pissed off I felt when my mom brought her home. There’s just flashes of seeing her napping as a baby on my Granma’s bed and I wanted so badly to pick her up and throw her into the trash can, and she was a tiny baby, she wasn’t premature or anything, she was just so tiny. Three year old me was crazy because all I thought was she was small enough for me to get rid of her. I feel horribly sickened with myself for even thinking that now. I can even vividly remember the day she was born, like the ride to the hospital and my granma and a nurse having to hold me back from being with my mom - like I can remember how scared and mad I felt, I was like a rabid animal, when she was rushed away, and I had been screaming and crying at the top of my lungs. But yeah, somehow as I got older I became so protective and close to my sister, mainly because my mom was a single mom and she had to work a lot, and we weren’t on welfare anymore so I (my older sister too) took care of her. She had been so sweet and adorable and lovable, I loved her so much, she was my best friend. Then she turned into this monster, she’s an alcoholic and acts identicallay like our pos father, who she has never spent more than a few hours with; she’s mean and I hate her, I absolutely fucking hate her and I wouldn’t be upset if I never saw her again.

Now that he is learning that, he has stopped telling us he needs to go and throws tantrums about struggling with his clothing or just pees in them.

If this generation has a high  rate of declining fertility does that not indicate to you that the next  generation may be smaller because of the adults that did not reproduce?**

I said there is an indication that it is not completely out of control, that there are already things occurring that seem to be assisting us in a prevention of over population.

"What's your definition of ""design""? If you mean CAD, that's pretty easy and you don't need a MS. If you mean working on the design and development of new aerospace vehicles or components, the answer is maybe. A general rule in engineering, and most jobs really, is advancement or project changes are experience based. If a structures person wants to suddenly do aerodynamics, that's going to be a hard move since they presumably don't have the background and experience in aerodynamics to contribute. For design and development of large projects, you'd only work on a certain aspect of the project like the aerodynamics, engines, landing gear, materials, etc. So an online MS could help if it's on a topic area that gives you knowledge to contribute there. But it's kind of a random guess what area any given project would need. Though an aerospace systems engineering based MS is generally useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Aerospace industry is way more distributed than most people think from the outside. No one person knows how an airplane or spacecraft works entirely. There's no Tony Stark in the real world, at least in large companies. For example SLS is developed by thousands of engineers across the US.

"You got it bro. You hate another man for joining a team that already gave your favorite player trouble so your emotions are too vested for you to see the difference between winning a Finals MVP before LeBron or winning a regular season MVP after KD. Finals MVP requires you to be clutch and the key factor on a champion. MVP can mean you were chasing rebounds instead of getting back on defense.

Edit: at least that's how Russ got his."

"We're both officers, so your experience will probably not be as bad, but the army literally has not given a single fuck about keeping us together.  I'm getting out in a month because my branch wont send me to her duty station after being apart for 7 months of CCC and the last year of fucking Korea.  

Most dual mil officers have similar experiences.  I think with the enlisted it's a little better since y'all's career timelines aren't as insanely rigid as ours."

"It just makes me sad. Everyone trying to get a piece of the moral high ground cake. If you keep playing a game that you think is catering to pedos, you are litterally funding them. You won't leave the game, changing is harder than complaining and calling people names.

I guarantee you that if 100% of the people who complained here about IS catering to pedos simply left the game in the week after B!Sanaki release, it would've made a far bigger impact on their decision to include or not another one for the event this year.

And from the look of the silhouettes, looks like you guys litterally funded another one by still playing. Kind of hope I'm wrong because I don't want another month+ of actual garbage arguments show off, and also kind of hope I'm right because I wouldn't want all this complaining shitfest to have bear fruits."

"When I met Adam Savage at the LA airport in 2008. I was a huge fan of the show, and I was excited to see him.

I understand that celebrities are often borderline harassed by fans 24/7, but he was litteraly just twiddling his thumbs while waiting for a flight. 

He was insanely rude and basically snapped at me. He told me to leave him alone before I even got a single word out. I was nine."

"You have curlier hair than you think - curly hair is frizzy and really dry. It also tangles easily. Condition like it will save your life - make sure to distribute it really well.

After washing it, gently scrunch it from ends to root to have it curl a little bit more. If you want, take some gel or mousse to tone down the little baby frizzies.

!Important! - do not brush your hair! Brushes are curly hair's worst enemy.

Start with /r/curlyhair, but don't feel as though you have to be religious about it."

"I love Dragon's Age and Dragon's Dogma, but they're not a lot alike besides the word dragon. DD is not plot and character driven like DA is, and the combat is really where it shines. I love the plot and the characters in this, but they are nowhere near the forefront of the game. It's closer to the hints and story that you'd get from reading codex entries for example. 

 Did you like the long dragon battles and crafting systems in Dragon Age? Then you might enjoy Dragon's Dogma. Or were you playing it for the character banter, choices and sidequests, and the romances? Then I would suggest the Mass Effect trilogy is a way better fit for you."

After Tesla and then everyone else following suit, electrics are cars that the average person wants to buy as good cars, and being electric is just another selling point."

If you are talking within the context of revolt/revolution/civil war you don't maintain power by glassing your infrastructure and tax base, you kind of want to avoid that scenario from happening to begin with. 


&gt;In the 2nd amendment scenario of military vs civilians, now the military doesn't have to worry killing civilians, because they're the target.

So they would prioritize foreign civilians that they don't have to answer to in any way and just wipe out their own citizens? How the hell are they supposed to maintain power in that scenario? That would just make rebellion even more popular."

Not only could he portray two different people effortlessly, but there was something about him that just radiated goodness and decency. And a cheerful innocence on top of it. You believed in his genuine integrity. 

I mean, he inhabited the character to the point where it was hard for people to ever imagine anyone else in the role after a while. That was no accident. And all the successors are still compared to him today. And it's not like he was the first person to play him, but he just fit the part like a glove."

We only had a few people at our actual ceremony and rented a private room at one of the bars close to home. Everyone was very understanding of it except my sister in law who gave birth a month before the wedding. My husband first asked me about it and I told him no and he agreed. We just figured the father of the child could stay home with the baby for a couple hours while the sister comes and at least gets dinner. My mother in law completely goes behind our back and allows the sister and infant to come. They literally just sat in the corner and left after a hour. She even still talks today about how she wish she could've stayed and tries to guilt me."

"I really like it, especially the fact its notion activated."
"Most states have several exceptions to that though -- e.g., if there is knowledge of the dog being violent. Under that understanding, and YOU think the dog is violent so we'll use that as our base, the bitten dog's owner would have been aware of the tendencies of the OP's dog -- therefore relieving the OP of responsibility. The OP has also made an effort to contain his dog (putting it in an enclosed yard) and the bitten dog still found a way around that; this means that reasonable measures were taken by the OP to protect others from his ""violent"" dog.

Additionally, from NOLO (on human incidents) to provide more sources and variety, ""The dog-bite laws in many states don’t apply in certain circumstances—mostly commonly, when the injured person provoked the dog or was trespassing. Some of these statutes make the victims (rather than the owners) prove they weren’t at fault."" 

Yes, this is speaking to human cases, but I'm illustrating how the law applies there. Courts tend to protect human beings more than animals -- yet  side with the dog on private property in the majority of instances.

And even if you don't agree with the law references here, I'm happy to debate the points I listed initially -- you ignored all of them and just started citing."

Edit: It has since been pointed out that this isn't entirely accurate, as parts of Manhattan are left out. Still mildly interesting that a straight line partway through Manhattan can cut the bottom off into a piece with a population within roughly 20 people of the population of South Dakota."

"&gt;Welp, this is kind of a narcissist's paradise, their ex's ex even dreams of them after they're dead. :/

My nex did not like my first husband. He didnt like someone being connected to me and the kids. He wanted me and the kids as his own. But he was terrified of my first husband because he had some power and I kept my Nex out of it completely starting day one. I think its why most of the abuse was when the kids were at their Dads, and rarely ever even hinted at when they werent. At least the physical abuse.  And men in general made him anxious, since he didnt know how to read them as well and really wanted their respect. 

I do wonder why he had this dream. My first husband almost died a little over a year ago. He just had the final surgery to deal with that happening about two months ago. It was nice to spend time with everyone, though, I have to say. His wifes family is so much fun and I really like them. Even though thats weird, I guess. 

I do wonder if what happened still upsets my first husband, makes him feel guilty or something that he didnt stop it. Thats kinda the person he is. He does have his own issues. Maybe hes processing some threat that he feels and my Nex is the boogie man in the dream but not the cause. 

But maybe Im also a bit thrown because I just realized a little while ago he used Nexes real name. I obviously dont use his name here. And I talk about what I went through, but with a Nex instead of the personalization of his name. My kids dont really talk about him anymore, or use his name. Hearing it spoken outloud by someone else may have done the trick. I was not expecting it. 

I doubt those cobwebs of mine will ever go completely away, even with all the therapy Ive done. Its a lesson we learn in life, a hard won lesson that sucks, admittedly. And Im certain Nex was the trigger for every single one of my conditions because Ive traced them all back to about a one month span of time when the symptoms all started. It just takes longer to get answers or diagnosis as you know. Bummer that is and all. Hopefully it will go away in the near future. Its just like irritating. Just there. Not sure what to do with it. ;)"

"Long answer:

125x^2 - 250x - 10000 = 0

We can simplify this into two factors 'a' and 'b' that are of the form:

a x b = 0

this is useful because that means that either a = 0 or b = 0 (or both).

So what are 'a' and 'b'?

-------------------

Well we know they multiply together to give:

125x^2 - 250x - 10000

which is just 

125 * (x^2 - 2x - 80) = 0

x^2 - 2x - 80 = 0 ÷ 125

x^2 - 2x - 80 = 0 is the same equation, but simpler to work with.

Do you remember the 'box' drawing used to explain multiplication when you were a kid? 

eg 34 x 45 looks like this: https://images.app.goo.gl/TPhd6orqvGkF2eGw5

Well we can do the same here except we know what's inside the boxes in the middle (x^2 - 2x - 80 ), we have to work backwards to get the numbers around the outside: 


&amp;nbsp;   | x^2 |   p   |

&amp;nbsp;    |   q    | - 80 |



and what ever the 'p' and 'q' numbers are they add up to -2x

There's all sorts of methods to solve this. The x's in the corners are easy, it's going to be (x + ?) * (x + ?), after that we need two numbers that multiply to give -80, and add to give -2. We end up with:

&amp;nbsp;        |   x  | + 8  |



&amp;nbsp;       x | x^2 | +8x |



&amp;nbsp;   -10 | -10x | - 80 |


(x + 8) * (x - 10) = x^2 + 8x - 10x - 80

(x + 8) * (x - 10) = x^2 - 2x - 80


So now we have:  (x+8) * (x-10) = 0

meaning either (x + 8) = 0 or (x - 10) = 0

so x = -8 or 10

and the wording of the question that gave rise to the equation probabily doesn't make sense if x is a negative number, leaving only x = 10 as the answer.

Hi, this literally just happened, I've never posted before on this sub and thought maybe you guys would have some insight. Apologies for any typos or formatting mistakes I'm on mobile. 

Background info: 

I've been dating my current girlfriend for a year and a half and I've known her for the past 5 years. We have quite a good relationship and our parents already know and we're planning on getting married when we're able to (this girl is literally the love of my life and this doesn't change that). About 5 or 6 months ago I met a girl at my university who seemed nice and we had some things in common so we started talking more. It was all platonic but my girlfriend didn't like this girl from the get go. They never met but from what she's heard/seen of her she's had a bad feeling about her. After several discussions and a few arguments where she tried to show me that while I may have good intentions, this girl seems pushy and might not want a completely friendly relationship. My gf had some good points and I agreed to put distance between me and the girl. And I did. 

Today's Problem:

Moving on to what happened today. Gf texted me and asked me about this girl. Specifically when did we last talk and what did we talk about. I answered her questions. But it didn't stop there, the questions kept coming and coming about every last detail of my recent conversations with this girl and at one point she said ""tell me everything I want the details"". So I had enough and told her ""You don't get to run an investigation on me about this. You know that all we talk about is memes and stuff about university so that's all the detail you need to know"". She starts berating me for ""fighting"" with her when she's just asking innocent questions. Thus far this is all on text. 

I call her and this is where the problem starts. She goes on a limb about how I'm free to tell her or not tell her whatever I want, and she's not forcing me to say. She even went as far as saying ""I only wanted to know if you talked recently you went and said everything else on your own"". She basically did a 180 on me and this sort of thing really pushes my buttons. This continued with her denying that she's asking too much and asking me ""what's wrong if I ask I just want to know"". Basically the opposite of the entire text conversation just minutes later. At this point I fucked up. I had tried to remain calm (I know it's no excuse but I think I might have anger issues) but after all that I blew up on her. I shouted and told her to get this shit out of her head and to grow up and stop asking so many stupid questions (among other not nice things). I compounded the fuck up by telling her ""stop crying, grow up"" when she started crying after all that.

I just completely lost it and now I hate myself because I love her so much and she's such a soft sweet girl and I can't believe I hurt her so much. 

I know I'm by no means innocent but who really is TA?

"If you're at a 38 in waist (and not super short), there is no way 1200 cal a day is healthy. The body tends to drop its metabolism if it thinks it's starving (meaning your energy level drops, you begin to feel sluggish, think slower, move slower, etc). This means that not only will it be harder to lose weight, you'll put it back on faster once you shift your diet back to a healthier style. This is known as the rubberband effect.

Figure out your TDEE and eat MAX of 20% under. (another commonly quoted number if 500 cal under) There's plenty of useful TDEE calculators online. A good diet + exercise routine can shed 1\~2 lbs per week off of you without burning too much muscle (you will burn some, but that's just the nature of things)

Also, if you're doing 2 hours of cardio per day, I hope you were doing 1.9 hours of cardio per day last week - especially if it's something high impact like running. Otherwise you run the risk of overuse injuries. Definitely increase your cardio if you're trying to make your run better - but adding too much too fast is just asking for injury.

Also, if your run time is decent and your goal is -fat loss-, then your best bet is actually a good strength training routine emphasizing compound lifts. Muscle burns more calories by default. Building muscle increases your metabolism. The guy the squats 300+ daily probably burns more calories sitting on his ass than you do on your hard run days. Not to mention an important part of the running equation is leg strength. I've seen people actually increase their speed by cutting back (but not eliminating) cardio and increasing legs days.

Keeping this stuff in mind - I can say with a good diet/exercise plan, I went from 38 in waist to 34 in. in about 2ish months and increased my run from 16:30 to 11:30 when I was preparing to enter the Air Force. It's doable but it'll be hard. #1 rule is don't skip workouts and don't cheat your diet. Fitness in and of itself is a marathon. You have to be able to bust your hump every day no matter how tired you are or how much you don't feel like doing it.

I would highly recommend getting with someone in your workcenter who is fitter than you and working out a plan. Get them to run with you, talk about your fitness and diet goals - make it known that you're trying to improve. This is what I did when a hardcore depression resulted in me ballooning up to 230 lbs and failing a pt test. I stayed pessimistic for a long time (please don't read my post history...), but perseverance, a good plan, and working with people who know better than me has me scraping the bottom end of a 90 again for the first time in years.

&amp;#x200B;

Or you could be like a lot of people - do a crash diet, run your ass off, and scrape by passing. Do it again in 6 months until your knees blow out then blame the Air Force PT program for breaking your body. To each their own?"

"Everytime that I see the name Haibara coming in a discussion I have to respond.
I started watching DC in 2002, when here in Italy first aired. I have seen it till 2010, little before the Clash of Red and Black. 
In January, when I was using YouTube, a video of DC appeared between the recommended videos. So i decided to rewatch it, all the episodes canon. I can obviously remember very well them, and I have to say that I agree with you. I think that till the Clash of Red and Black the anime was perfect, but after that things started to go little downhill. Too many characters and a story too slow.
I would have preferred more focus on the ""older"" characters, like Haibara and Heiji.
Another things to underline is that I don't like the ""new"" Haibara. WTF is her attitude in the last episodes after losing the strap? 
I'm a huge fan of Haibara, but from my comments I think you understood that ��
So in the end, I think I totally agree with you, I'll continue to ship her with Shinichi, and no one else. 
Let's hope that our loved Haibara will appear more and more in the next episodes, files, and that can have some good stories like the good times ( Reunion with BO, Halloween Party, were absolutely gems, I think it's not a coincidence that the best episodes have a high dose of Haibara)."

That’s probably why JC is using the Fairy and Abraxan as the first SQs with Hagrid:  to try to get players to adopt and max them even though they are not good investments for spending your books and not popular because of that.

You will need all but 2 Creatures maxed to get to Level 7 where you can adopt the Unicorn."

"Make sure it's got a block heater and that all the heating and de-icing stuff works, first and foremost. You will probably be needing to plug it in overnight once you get onto the prairies, and for sure once you get north of about Edmonton. For the East coast, get led bulbs for your headlights and taillights so they're visible through the fog. Make sure the radio works, and as you get more rural/remote/north, USE it to keep track of the weather and do not be arrogant about driving conditions. Mother Nature is beautiful, but she doesn't give a shit about you. Make sure you have kitty litter, a shovel (both for if you get stuck or there's ice), blankets, flashlights (it will be dark most of the day at that time of year), and high calorie snacks in the car. Chains for the tires probably wouldn't hurt, but if you're staying on big highways they might not be necessary. Get a map because I guarantee your reception will disappear on you at some point. 

Most important? A camera for the northern lights and wildlife, something to listen to while driving, and the willingness to talk to strangers. You'll be driving through some of the friendliest parts of this continent and most people will be interested in your story and your trip - and very happy to have someone new listening to their stories!

"Duuuuude.

So basically I hang out in this chat with a small groip of people. After a year on/off convoys, One is moving near me so we meet up. There's this other one that's thinking about coming to my city to study and I'm really excited (we're all same gender) how we'll hang out and do lots of stuff together.

Then one day one of them tells me that they are in a relationship. I didn't have a problem with their relationship but I felt weird how I had this idea of us all being friends but actually they had moved to SOs. I sorts stopped talking to all of them so much, just quick his how are yous in a bigger chat. 3rd friend finally moved to my city but we never met.

I just thought it'd be weird and I'd feel awkward as a third wheel if we ever met up. Didn't feel like putting myself through this so I sort of kept a distance. I'm probably an asshole but the point of having online friendships is to save me from those awkward situations. I wasn't going to put myself through this.

Also in my mind, me and friend 2 were going to meet irl friend 3 for the first time together. But it was not meant to be. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"

"Here's an example
 I played in an adventure today, where we discovered that a noble family had made an infernal deal. They had sold their 12 year old twins' souls to the ruler of Baator. The spirit of the family's knightly ancestor confirmed that they were instead planning to sacrifice 100 townsfolk instead. If the sacrifice didn't happen, the kids' souls were forfeit. According to the spirit, killing the parents was the only way to save both kids and townsfolk, which the spirit was OK with. After the 10th level wizard mother fell, both the father (15th level cleric of Asmodeus) and some cultists kept trying to revive her. I started piling on the AoE damage to hurt him and kill her. After HE finally fell, I (5th level halfling bard) went over to his unconscious body and slit his throat. When our DM asked if I had started playing CE, I replied that it was the only way to save the innocent kids. I then personally took the kids to the temple of Ogmha for safe keeping."

So, I tried to fabricobble a steel table using some old square tubing I had laying around, the thing is... It was more rust than steel. lost a good time with the wire weel, and by the time I had most of the rust out, was left with too little steel. I have a cheap 220v transformer mig welder. it has no fine-tunning of the amperage and voltage, although I can lay a nice bead if the weather it's just right. But that old more-than-five-years-on-the-rain steel did kicked my butt. My question it's, whats causing some of the situations? Am I running too hot, too cold, too fast, too slow, too much wire, too little wire? all of the above? And how can I be a better welder? What should I look for when I'm crafting? Don't worry, I don't do this for a living, this is only but a hobbie for me, I will not put a weld like that out in the wild."

I haven't watched Milo Murphy's since like the beginning of season 1 but weren't they supposed to crossover or did that already happen?

"Only one foul from Giannis in the first half.  I anticipate freight train Giannis in the 3rd, with (probably) one charge, maybe more.

Why does that mean it's not a consequence?
"Hey mods - Just an FYI that the wiki isn't easily accessible from the main page. I would recommend putting a link to it at the bottom of the intro blurb.

"Aw... Weiss is absolutely adorable.

Also, I like how the outfits are clearly oversized, considering their teammates are like a half foot taller than them."

I can't tell if you're being facetious. I wouldn't trade my 1st round pick 1:1 for a guy someone got off waivers with an injury history longer than Chris Davis' hitless streak even if he is playing really well. Anyone who drafted JRam should be holding for better days
"It’s heavy and harsh, but also valuable criticism. Sometimes it’s what you need to progress and really become a great artist. 
She clearly has some solid talent, but you need more than that. There’s so many talented people out there and the Internet has made exposure easier than ever, especially through people’s phones. It just so happens that avenue of exposure is exactly what she chose to criticize, you know?"
"I'm Commander Shepard, and these are my favorite NPCs on the Citadel."
"Wait, is it common to put your colour skin in your forms?! Belgian here so Idk how it works in US, maybe I just misunderstood something but that sounds weird"
"I very much doubt it, even though there are enough publically available sources there that things like MACE can be built (which is infinitely more in depth than DCS' EW simulation) ED has always been very careful with the RWRs, I doubt this one will be different."

Anything that a property holder of the community does will have to be permitted by the contractor. If he wants to expand operations he will need permition from the contractor to only have whites on board or allow blacks on it.

It sucks he gets actually abused in public for being such a good actor.
Bray?
"You shouldn’t feel bad, but I don’t think she did anything wrong either. When you’re at a bar and talking to someone of the opposite sex, regardless of your intentions, there’s usually going to be flirtation. Adding onto that, in Vegas you aren’t even allowed to sit at a table unless you have bottle service or get invited to a table that does. Most girls would jump at that, especially since we usually have to wear heels to get into clubs. I get it doesn’t feel good to hear that she flirted with someone else, but I also get why she did it. It’s a shitty situation for both of you, so I would just talk it out when she gets back and explain how you feel face to face."

"I'm Rick Harrison, and this, is my Pawn shop. You never know what's gonna come through that door.”
2:30pm:
Thanos walks into the store, drawing looks from the crowds inside. Rick, unfazed, holds out his hand.
“Hey pal,” said Rick. “What can I do for you?”

“Balancing the universe has done a number on my wallet. I'm looking to sell you this…”
Thanos places the complete infinity gauntlet on the table. Rick looks it over.
“Wow, this is something else.”

“How much do you want for it?” Rick asks, eyeing Thanos dead on.
Thanos shuffles.
“Well, I was hoping to get about a couple million for it.”

Rick grits his teeth, checking over the gauntlet as Thanos crosses his arms in anticipation.
“Alright, well… I'm no expert on this kind of universal superweapon. Mind if I get someone from the back?”
The mad Titan grudgingly agrees.
Enter Chumlee.

“Hey what's up man.” Chumlee shakes hands with Thanos. “Ooh, the Infinity Gauntlet. That's a nice piece man!”
Thanos grins as only he could. This was perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
“How much are you looking at?” Chumlee asks Thanos.
“A couple of million.”

Rick looks to Chumlee. It doesn't look good for Thanos.
“Yeah, sorry man. There are a lot of these around at the moment… This is a nice piece, all complete…”
“That's got to be worth something, right?” Asks Thanos.
Rick looks to Thanos and says:
“Best I can do is five bucks pal.”
Thanos, furious at how outrageously undersold the value of the gauntlet is, takes the gauntlet and snaps his fingers."
Probably crazy happier than me!!
Perfect�� I expect nothing less from her than the absolute least amount of effort.

2:30pm:
Thanos wawks into the stowe, dwawing wooks fwom the cwowds inside. Wick, unfazed, howds out his hand.
“Hey paw,” said Wick. “What can I do fow you?”

“Bawancing the univewse has done a numbew on my wawwet. I'm wooking to seww you this…”
Thanos pwaces the compwete infinity gauntwet on the tabwe. Wick wooks it ovew.

Are there bad open-backs? Of course, but it's telling that the vast majority of high-end headphones ($1000+) are open-back.

Are you going to be using this in public transport or right next to other people? If so, get closed-back.

"Literally this game was not xmithies fault. Sad to say but doublelift was the worst performing memeber on the team. I was watching the final on reapereds stream that’s what he said which I agree with. 

For example, when doublelift  got hooked by thresh you’ll see in the replay how corejj is standing behind a minion and doublelift isn’t. This is literally just a rookie mistake that he shouldn’t be making. Furthermore, botlane would always start out with losing lane and die to basically every time jankos came by. Meanwhile xmithie tries to get advtanges on the other side of the map it’s too hard to match because g2 members obviously won’t die that easily. Double lifts performance was the most dissapointing in the final"

"Hip hop at the moment is incredible. I’ll blast  blood-pumping flex songs by artist like Cardi and Nicki Minaj and it honestly makes me feel badass and confident. 

But on a more serious note, I think a lot of hip hop artists are realizing that it’s a great genre for communicating their own pain and the human condition. In my opinion, music at its core is a form of poetry, and hip hop is a platform where you can spit out a lot of lyrics in one song. There is a lot to be communicated about social issues and what we all individually struggle with as humans. Artists like Kendrick, Tyler the Creator, Death Grips, and Lil Peep are the primary musicians to get this message across to me. And for the record, I think what Lil Nas came up with in Old Town Road was revolutionary in the music world."

""In early winter one bird waited to fly south, by the time the bird had finally began his journey it was too cold and the bird was caught in a snow storm which caused his wings to freeze and the bird fell to the ground. As the bird was laying freezing to death a cow came along a took a big steaming shit on top of the bird. The warmth from the shit warmed the bird up and dethawed its wings however as it laid in shit a cat came along and dug the bird out.....and ate it.""

"&gt; And that's why the USD/US Treasury is still he safest asset to hold. 

I understand where you are coming from, but looking at charts like this

[https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/purchasing-power-of-the-us-dollar-1913-to-2013\_517962b78ea3c\_w1500.jpg](https://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/purchasing-power-of-the-us-dollar-1913-to-2013_517962b78ea3c_w1500.jpg)

It makes you second guess if holding USD is a smart or safe thing to do.

Also considering that it took 100 years to get to the 2008 amount, and since 2008 they have more than doubled the money supply in the last 10 years so how can inflation still be 2-3% after all that printing?

If the USD was not the world currency, inflation would be much much higher, but lucky we can ship the inflation over seas."

"Can’t speak for the rest of Europe but in the UK (London specifically), all public transport will come to a stop by the end of Xmas eve and not start up again until the 27th. This is because traditionally Boxing Day (26th) is also a public holiday (however now we have the Boxing Day sales so things will be open and crazy).

On Xmas day, the only things open will likely be in Asian enclaves. 

On Boxing Day many places will be open, and from the 27th onwards it’s back to normal, though the Xmas period is generally when various transport companies/etc do any works that may be required as it’s generally a quieter period, so some services may be reduced

"&gt; By ""Marry"" I am referring to the Christian Religious ceremony most specifically, which is what is usually thought of when there is campaigning for equal rights in this domain.

This is false. Those campaigns are only for civil marriage; the type of marriage provided by states and governments.

&gt; It is clearly inherent within the Christian doctrine that Marriage is a ceremony reserved for the specific partnering of a Man and a Woman, and is forbidden to same sex relationships. Therefore, due to this discrimination, would this not be similar to say a black man wanting to be part of the Klu Klux Klan?

First of all, there are [Christian denominations](http://time.com/3749253/churches-gay-marriage/) that offer same-sex marriage already. Doctrine is and always has been a question of interpretation.

Secondly, the KKK analogy doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Are you saying that the institution of marriage (religious or otherwise) was specifically created with the purpose of fighting and oppressing same-sex couples?"

"Could be asexual or demi-sexual

Asexual you've probably hear of. Demi-sexual means you don't have primary sexual attraction (lust, basically), but you have *secondary* attraction which builds after getting to know someone (""love,"" generally, but also a ""second (or first) wave"" of sexual attraction/desire--and you can have either or, but not the other).

The issue is that primary sexual attraction ""gets us in the door"" and secondary attraction ""makes us stick around"" (or makes us leave if we don't like what we see). So you might have to ""force"" yourself to meet people. This way you might be able to tell if you have secondary sexual attraction or not...

If not, then you're likely asexual.

*Although,* and this is just the tip of the iceberg of this extremely complex topic... It could be that you are demi-sexual, and *also* only compatible of being attracted to a very *specific* type of person.

I am somewhat similar, but not the same. I have both primary and secondary attractions but I am not ""wired"" for the current social status quo (superficiality, ""hookup culture"", non-smoker, etc), and on top of that, i'm only compatible with specific types of people in general, so my social circles have always been small.

As for the feeling left out.... I'm sorry but it's unavoidable. You can't force yourself to feel something that doesn't come naturally. You may (or may not) be able to ""train"" yourself to... but the ethics and philosophical questions surrounding that is an entire semester's worth of college in an of itself, at least."

"so the multi-channel radio control systems is an invention to allow proper control over devices like torpedoes. To simply put, imagine if you have a radio controlled toy, they normally work on transmission on a single channel, so whoever knows the channel can fuck with you and takeover your toy. Same works for torpedoes. So what was done here is that they gave the radio system a periodic switching mechanism to switch between channels to avoid the enemy to fuck with their radio control coz they don't know what channels to switch to. Or, in street terms, it's like a dealer telling you to call him on a different phone, then hangs up in 20sec and continue the call on a 3rd number so nobody knows wtf is going on even if they're wire tapping one of his phones. And that is sort of the basis of modern encryption tech."

Additionally there are all kind of weird cases. For example let’s say you get a job making $40k and you have $75k in student debt. Now your tax bracket becomes the same as someone making $100k meaning that if you do direct deposit from your job you’ll more than likely owe more at the end of the year even if you set deductions to zero."

"Same. I’m 8w7. I have some heavy anger triad tendencies—8,9,1. I think all people are controlling; it simply manifests itself differently. For me, my control issues manifest in lots of places but mostly in my confrontational tendencies. My bff type 2 is controlling in the specific way she does things, in how she’s the planner so that we do all the things she wants the way she wants, and she masks her control over her boys by saying that she’s just “being safe” with them. My sister, on the other hand, is similar to what you’re describing. Gossip and manipulation are how she controls her life. If she’s always talking about someone else’s life, then she doesn’t have to face the inadequacies in her own life. Also, to punish me for whatever she doesn’t agree with in my life, she seems to purposely exclude me and my husband from family affairs as well as gossip about us. Because she’s my sister, I try to be compassionate. That’s how she expresses her pain. But you’re right, unhealthy type 2 CANNOT be trusted.

"In New England. I lost my hives two years ago and since I was quite pregnant last spring decided not to replace them. This year we’re moving the hives and we’ll replace the bees next spring. 

In the mean time, I can confirm a lot of solitary bees, bumbles and carpenters. My husband also reported finding what he described as “green bees” living in a pot from which he was moving hops. I didn’t see these green bees, so I can only assume he wasn’t hallucinating them.

We live in a swampy area, and while we always have mosquitos, I also am lucky that I get to see some of the earliest bee foraging of the season. Snow will still be on the ground but skunk cabbage will be emergent and their flowers (which look like a squid beak) generate their own heat source and pop through the late spring snow. I can report that the bees here got plenty of foraging from the skunk cabbage, but I won’t see them again for a few weeks as they’ve moved on to other forage and won’t be back until my borage blooms."
This reminds me of the Edge/Batista feud. Where Edge kept getting fluke wins that were entirely Batista's fault

"&gt;By ""Marry"" I am referring to the Christian Religious ceremony most specifically, which is what is usually thought of when there is campaigning for equal rights in this domain.

Your entire premise is flawed.  That's not at all what I or anyone I know consider the campaign for gay equality to be about.  It's about the right to be legally married and thus have access to all the legal benefits that come along with marriage.  

The only people who think the campaign for gay marriage is about forcing Christianity to recognize gay marriage are Christians who are opposed to it."

"&gt;Nonhuman animals are sentient very much like us. We don't need to kill or eat them for survival, as evidenced by many studies and millions of healthy vegans.

Ok but when has need ever stopped us? You can live healthy as a Vegan but we dont need to. Even if we eliminate cattle and dairy we still dont need to abandon meat. Lab grown meat is a happy medium and it's technically vegan

&gt;Enslaving and murdering a living being for 5 minutes of taste pleasure is straight up wrong.

Based on what? Your opinion?

&gt;The usual responses (""natural,"" ""tradition,"" ""we've always done it this way"") are all fallacies. 

Theres tons of fallacies in your reasoning. My morals are not yours but that's the only argument you're employing.

&gt;I get it if change seems hard, I know I saw veganism that way once. But it's not. There are delicious vegan alternatives, and there's no reason any one on Reddit in a developed country should be non-vegan.

There are plenty of reasons, you just dont like them."

&amp;nbsp;

Canapés - Four ingredients, four steps

&amp;nbsp;

Ingredients

* Plain crackers
* Plain goat cheese
* Lemon pepper seasoning
* Smoked salmon/canned oysters

Steps

1. Kneed the lemon pepper seasoning into the goat cheese with your hands until it tastes good (Don't eat it all, you need some to make the food)
1. Spread coating of goat cheese mix on crackers as thick as cracker is, leave slight border around the edge bare
1. Top with smoked salmon/oysters
1. Serve with white wine, sparkling is great, [Henkell Trocken](https://www.henkell.com/en/sparkling-wine/) is my go-to, it's cheap and no-one knows it's cheap if they don't see the bottle.

My friends had a shotgun wedding and gave me a days notice and $200 to prep apps. I bought everything at a ""no frills"" type grocery store, took three people less than 20 minutes to prep for a two-hour serving. Bride said I was the only thing that went right. Now I'm now ""the canapé guy"" and I'm pretty sure I'm the reason every get-together is a pot-luck."

"I’ve been there, girl. Especially around your age, I struggled with self-confidence, and when you look around and see so many “perfect” people your age, it’s disheartening. I grew up with low self esteem, telling myself that once I was 16 and until I was 30, I’d look perfect like everyone else. But you’ve got to grab onto what you’ve got and flaunt it. Not very single person can have every single physical trait that can be considered attracting. Yes, beachy blonde waves are pretty, but so many girls would KILL for your beautiful ringlets. As for your fave, your skin tone is so damn flattering, looks clear and super healthy, and omg, those cheekbones are going to add to your beauty for the rest of your gorgeous life &lt;3"

"Hey, sister here! I'm so sorry your mom is sloppy with that! I have a lot of food intolerances (not life-threatening, thankfully, but can make my life very difficult) and a few allergies, so I understand how frustrating it can feel. I get frustrated with people who think I'm being dramatic or who try to slip me things I can't handle because they don't care.

I wish that everyone could just eat and not have to worry about what foods they're eating.

But while we wait for that utopia, I wanted to tell you how proud I am of you! You are taking charge of your health and safety! I know it's frustrating to have to scrounge for packaging, but the fact that you are doing it shows that you are becoming such a responsible young adult! The dedication it takes to stay on top of allergies \*without\* someone tripping you up is hard enough, so I see this post as proof that you are working hard.

I saw a few comments down that you're going to college soon! Congratulations!!! Hope you learn a lot and feel a great sense of relief as your food consumption becomes less reliant on your mom! You got this!"

"My pup who is just now a year old, started doing this when he was probably 4 months old. Just like future\_best\_friend said, the unpredictable movements and high energy of kids were just confusing to him so he'd bark at them, once he was allowed to approach them though he was fine so I think it was really a frustration of not being apart of the fun for him more than fear, but with most dogs it is fear based because kids are weird.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also start socializing first with calmer older children, but the other thing I'd recommend is train your dog to be comfortable with a muzzle on as if you really think the dog is a risk to kids, I would only introduce with a muzzle just to be safe. You don't want that kind of lawsuit."

Literally can’t trust any of these people and I wouldn’t even be surprised now if Tati just made the 2nd video to try to get media presence off of her before the actual receipts blew up...

"Eh, no.  There's a reason putting small-block Chevy V8s in S10s and Blazers was all the rage...

Comparatively speaking there's almost no performance aftermarket support for the 4.3 motors because they were used exclusively in the S10/Blazer and stripper-1/2 ton trucks, and you'd be surprised how little actually interchanges with the SBC:  Pistons, valves/springs/lifters, maybe the water pump depending on the model-year, and the harmonic balancer are about it.  Even the rods &amp; bearings were different.  It's missing one of the V8's oil galleries, the heads sucked, and high-horsepower applications would oval the #1 cylinder bore over time.  Hot Rod built one up to 300 hp from the stock 195 back in 2002 when they were still in production but they had to spend a fairly silly amount of money to make it happen with a bunch of machine work.  Getting them balanced at anything higher than stock power is an exercise in frustration as well.  Vortech made a blower kit for it at one point but again, if you're spending that kind of money in 2019 you might as well get an LLT or LFX ""High-Feature"" V6; smaller, lighter, and makes 300+ hp out of the crate.

Not to mention the FW models that are no longer produced still have their scrolls. Hell, the older dwarf stuff is still there and dispossessed are still a thing if you go with the argument that they phased it out since it didnt make it into the battletome. Point being, they phased something out that had no business being pulled out like that. If i remember, their old sigvald model was resin and they have demonstrated that they are willing to keep things in armies even if they are resin. It legit took away from the army and left the mortal section with 2 warcrolls that, honestly, didn't need to be separated because it is legit a difference of a weapon option. I'd be more hopeful that they are redesigning it and are just gonna have us print out the new warscrolls or something. They did the same thing with Legions of Nagash and Nighthaunt battletomes where it amended old warscrolls and added new ones to the older tome.

I was in my teens, and had no phone, and it took me quite a while to get home from there... so I didn’t call anyone about it. I wouldn’t have been able to pinpoint the exact location anyway, and wasn’t totally sure of what I’d seen. Creepy though."

"If you are creating a table, I'm assuming you are getting the data from a table that is already there. What I mean is that in the future if you add a column to the table, you will have to go add it to all of the other tables or whatever you report in will spit out an error saying it cant find a column if you try to query an old table.  Famous last words ""this table will never change"". 

If you need static tables (to not update, say you have a return 3 months later) I would create an archive database (on the same server). There is always a problem when you have two  copies of the same time period/data that don't disagree.  

Also please DO NOT select * in your query. It is a nightmare to maintain. List the columns out. 

If that doesnt make any sense let me know."

"I’ve had some games I was frustrated with at the end. You’ll grow from this for sure. 

Learning tactics to deal with rough play and dissent grows with experience, you try to raise your game incrementally, but there isn’t a science to this and sometimes you get into a really challenging game.

In my experience, more competitive games often have physical play, and the players sometimes want to play through it. Over time, you develop ways to sense what players will accept and what they won’t and you can give them the game they want.

As far as dissent, a lot of that comes from the confidence you project and how you assert yourself especially the first few times it happens. 

Keep reffing my friend, get your game count up, and roll with the punches. Recovering from challenging games is part of the process. You’ll be better for it on and off the field."

"Make sure you are ready to make some changes. If your commitment is weak don’t move on it. Be ready. 
Then commence a food plan you can live with long term. I’ve personally tried so many different food plans that I could not sustain that I almost gave up too. I saw my doc, and told him I was compulsively, uncontrollably eating and that I couldn’t stop. He put me on low dose fluoxetine, and had me see a therapist to talk about “why” I was compulsively eating. (Honestly, not sure it matters why. Same as some of the things you described. Knowing why hadn’t really helped. I needed to stop the compulsive behavior, and substitute it with a healthier lifestyle.) 
I can do low carb. I’ve found that I’m able to stay on low carb bc occasionally I feel the need to eat a lot. And as long as the food is the right food, sometimes eating a  lot of food still allows me to lose weight. I’ve lost 35 lbs since January. But I’ll tell you, had I not been absolutely ready to make major changes I could not have done this. I still cook for my fam, go out to restaurants, celebrate birthdays, etc. But I maintain my food plan. 
You can do this too. You are worth it, and you deserve to be happy and healthy. Tell yourself this 20 times a day. Then when you are ready, jump head in on a plan that you know you can stick with for the long term. Weight loss is not fast and not easy, so also get an app of positive affirmations you can read daily. Your mind has Stockholm Syndrome from the constant beating down you’ve experienced from the very people who are supposed to protect and nurture you so you flourish. You’ll have to protect and nurture yourself so you flourish. You can do this.

"I've started taking up the idea that ""eight years is more than enough to learn algebra, history, and how to compose and read a sentence. High school is for learning how to function as an adult."" Looking back on my school career, there was a lot of time wasted. Why did we take two entire years learning addition and subtraction (first and second grade)? Why weren't we taught all the way up through mutiplication and division that first year? Why did I go over Rome's history in four different years between middle school and high school? What the hell did we even do in English class before Freshman year?

Those first eight years? That's more than enough time for all of the academic ""core"" classes. I think by high school math, history, science, English should all be electives. I wish I came out of high school, and I want future generations coming out of high school, knowing how the electricity in their home works, how to fix a car, how to repair their plumbing. People should be coming out of high school with the credits necessary for performing those sorts of jobs professionally right out the gate (in addition to maybe learning what the federal government expects of them as adult citizens. Why are taxes not a mandatory course?) College is for doctors and scientists."

"I'm not doubting that you went through depression, or that you went through BDD. I'm going through clinically diagnosed depression right now and it's shit. This is not a dick measuring contest about who's suffered the most in life. This is about your comment of ""love finding it's way to you"" and legitimately believing in that. It shows such ignorance that it's laughable. 

To repeat, you are a pretty, young, white woman. You won the fucking lottery of the dating world. At the top of the totem pole. And while it may be hard, or even impossible to believe that you're attractive when you have BDD, that doesn't change how the men in your surroundings view you; as a pretty woman. 

Of course, being you comes with drawbacks. I'm not speaking about what those are, I have no clue. I am however very jealous of it's plus sides. I look at your lot in life, and from where I am it looks amazing. People finding you attractive, desiring you, trying to be with you, trying to get closer to you etcetera, things I have never experienced myself you have more than you could ever want. 

And that's just it. We can't possibly relate to each other. Grass is always greener, yada yada. Nothing you can say will help anyone in here, since no one here can look at you without feeling jealousy. And why would we take your tips seriously? You will never know what life ugly men live. I will never know what life you live as a woman, either. So why are you really here?"

My girlfriend’s parents have tons of issues. Her biological dad is lazy and was pretty much out of the picture during her childhood. Her step dad is constantly emotionally manipulating her over texts and when I’m not around. He’s constantly bitching about she isn’t around enough and how she treats him like shit  and calls her lazy (even though she works her ass off in retail). When her dad gets really assholish over texts on our dates, she starts crying and it pretty much ruins the date. This has happened a few times and I’m fucking tired of it. Her mom doesn’t do anything about it. She lives at home with her parents, as do I and she doesn’t drive or have enough money to get her own place. She constantly talks about how much she hates her life and it brings me down as well. She doesn’t have enough money to see a therapist and her parents don’t believe that depression is a real thing and that you just need to “toughen up”. When she calls me crying about what her step dad did or what her mom said to her it makes me feel bad and ultimately stressed. She’s 20 and works retail and I’m a 19 year old college student. My family tells me that if this puts too much stress and negativity into my life that I should consider breaking up. Would I be the asshole if this were my reason?

I’m not against people wearing visors like some people here, however I would suggest against it if you are playing in very low level games as the majority of players have little control over the puck and their sticks, but people can make their own decisions. I recently started playing in low level games with some friends and made the change to a cage and now I love it for the lack of maintenance so that’s why I figured I would offer my perspective in this thread."

Side Note: Zubac is a FA, so he can't be included and even if he is included, he's a C. The Pelicans have been stockpiled bigs in anticipation of AD leaving. Diallo, Randle, Okafor, Wood, so I'm pretty the Pelicans would rather just get another first.

One note, the Pelicans do have 4 additional seconds. Milwaukee 2020, and then Washington 2020, 2022, and 2023. You might see New Orleans include one or two those in order to wrangle an extra first rounder."

"I am not the one you responded to, but that is indeed how I see it (although I would also say that ""my mother was pregnant with me"" because everyone knows what one means by that). The fetus was a precursor to me, something that was still developing into me. For that same reason it would not have been sad if my (now) mother had aborted the fetus that became me. I simply would not have come into being and that would have been okay. 

I regard the born person as an independent individual. Therefore at birth you wouldn't have to say 'the fetus that became me was born' because it is then also true that 'I was born'. Your last example (the child who became me went to first grade) is therefore not a sentence I would use. Even though sometimes it definitely feels that way!"

My husband works his ass off and when he comes in it’s all excitement as our kids run to him, and he will spend the two hours between home time and bed time solidly focusing on our son. And then because our daughter is older and goes to bed later he will spend quality time with her. Weekends he is up early anyway (always been an early riser) so he takes our son for donuts and coffee and then does yard work outside so me and our daughter can catch up on sleep. He’s a saint. He’s not perfect for sure, and we have our arguments (especially lately - did you know you can get post partum depression from adopting? Me neither... I haven’t been the easiest to deal with lately), but he’s always been an involved parent, coaching on our daughters hockey and he never misses a concert or recital. I told him I was burned out last week and Wednesday he told me “I called your friend and tomorrow night you’re going there to sleep and hang out. I’ll only text in an emergency. Sleep in. Eat a lunch. As long as you’re back by 3:00 pm to pick them up from school, I don’t care what you do with your day. Just rest.” 

All he asked of me was to please make their school lunches before I left Thursday for Friday morning so he had an easier morning getting them to school. He just randomly called my friend and asked if I could sleep there and go and relax and be away from the stress.

At first I thought she was too much for this game, now I just love her! 

Her overloaded design makes that she has some of the most awesome gear in the game, her gameplay is actually a way nicer than I expected, she is an excellent zoner that has some combo potential and it's amazing how she can get the job done close, but her speciality is by distance. 

Also, in this game she is not that hard to defeat, this makes the Cetrion player more cautious...

Something that turns into a full-fledged human being is alive, by every definition of the word. You can say it can’t survive outside the womb for a time. Yes. Just like fish can’t survive out of water and we can’t survive in water. If you don’t want the child, put it up for adoption. There are waiting lists. Better yet don’t get pregnant. There’s choice there too. I haven’t brought up God. You might need God or something like it lol - your view of life is grim, and that probably reflects in your own life - but again, no anti-abortion argument has to do with the woman. I don’t care what she thinks. If you view it as the killing of an innocent being, the argument ends there."

"Yes, Paracesis is good against him. But there's something much better (if we exclude exalted weapons like Valkyr and Excalibur).

Dark-Split Sword. (the dual blade version)

This thing deal only radiation. It has 25% crit chance and 2,5x crit multiplier. It has high attack speed (you don't have to use berserker, Primed Fury is enough).

Properly builded, this weapon can melt him (the Tactical Alert version from 2nd mission) in about 10 seconds. 

Whenever I went to Hydron or Helene to level up stuff, I always had this meat grinder equipped.

Wolf on 75 lvl on normal mission (not the Tactical Alert, where he's weaker than his normal version) went down crazy fast. For a single weapon this is a big success (I know that Warframes with exalted weapons can melt him in 10 seconds).

I don't know how fast Paracesis would kill him, but I'm sure that Dark-Split Sword is equal or even better."

"Wait, it says she suffered a miscarriage after Courtland punched her in the stomach but wasn't he the father when she had the abortion? I'm thinking this article got it right since it says he was charged after she miscarried....so does this mean she got pregnant *again* after he beat her so bad she lost the prior pregnancy?

If she didn't have these children depending on her, I would really feel for her. It's obvious she has some very real issues that push her into these abusive relationships. But it's not about just her anymore and she doesn't have the luxury of putting her feelings first anymore. She was quoted saying that she knows she picks abusive men because she doesn't want to be alone so she's aware of her patterns. That means she knows what she's doing and she really needs to put her kids first for once. This is sickening. If those kids survive their childhoods they're doomed to repeat the patterns they witnessed their whole lives. It's so sad."

"Difficult to diagnose over the internet, but the easiest to address would be muscle tightness and poor hip stability which can manifest in calf pain/tightness from overworking to compensate. As has been stated, if you aren’t stretching - start! Hamstrings, hip flexors and calves. For your calves, you should hang off a step for 1-3 minutes to really get a good static stretch. Also, slowly lowering yourself down then pushing up to an isometric hold has been shown to be beneficial. Work up to 10-15 holding for a five count up on you toes. If stretching does seem to help, you might try a night splint as well. 

I would also recommend this routine (or something similar) to address hip flexibility and stability. I can’t remember the exact number but I want to say something like 70% of runners complaining of calf pain had some type of hip muscle disfunction. It’s been a while since I read the research, but that’s the number that sticks in my head.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=utUu_fzUo_Q

You should take a break from running for a few weeks and focus on the stretching and strengthening. After that start with a run 1 minute/walk 1 minute routine for 10-15 minutes and slowly build your running time as able without exacerbation of symptoms. If you don’t see a decrease in symptoms, I would recommend finding a PT that works with runners. (I am a PT, but again this can be complicated and difficult to assess in a chat)


Good luck!"

"Non US gun owner here, ultimately it is the gun owners responsibility to ensure their firearms are not misused.  I'd have stiff penalties applied to me if anyone got a hold of a non stolen firearm.  Aside from wilderness areas they must be stored locked up, or inoperable.

Still doesn't seem like a bad idea to teach people how to deal with guns if they encounter them.  Guns are everywhere in the US, with plenty of irresponsible gun owners.  I really do think the onus needs to be on the owner, where I am we need to take safety courses and be tested before we can own firearms.  IMHO having a safety course for legal firearms owners is much. much more important as it's a rarity I hear about something dumb being done with a legal firearm here compared to the US.

Teaching children about firearms can be beneficial.  I don't think it's going to make a huge impact, there will always be a desire for children to play with firearms, or be afraid of them enough the bomb squad ends up coming."

"That's not really the point the paper makes, I think you're missing what they claim is the cause and what is the effect. The paper argues that, counterintuitively, adding more housing supply might not help affordability in cities. It will just enable more knowledge-workers to move in to the neighborhoods they want to live in, who can already afford the units currently there. It's arguing that inequality is what makes just increasing the housing supply an incomplete solution to help with housing affordability.

This doesn't necessarily contradict what many people say here either - over a 20 year time horizon, yes, building more will help with prices. But building more does cause displacement in the short-term that can't be ignored. I just think that this sub really lacks nuance when talking about housing development, which hurts it's credibility with people on the fence about liberalizing development regulations."

I agree that it's stupid to think anything is going to happen over it, but they did tell everyone that there was an upcoming Artifact tournament.  It's not like they were thinking about holding a tournament and everyone assumed it was definitely happening, Gabe told everyone that the tournament is happening, and that everyone would have a chance to participate.  Well, technically he only told the people at TI8 that they could try to participate, but it doesn't matter since the tournament was cancelled anyway."

"Doesn't do much good for the genre or for themselves at all. Very unlikely to actually pursue opera or learn proper technique that is required for that genre. Most will end up opting out of ""opera""/classical completely. 

However, I do have to say that there are a few exceptions. Patricia Janeckova is a good example. She did not start off trying to emulate a grown adult voice. Well to be honest, she did at some points, but at least she had better control and did not go full on overboard. Here's a clip of her when she was 12 [singing ""Time to Say Goodbye""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJUojuP-QU) and another one [singing O mio babbino de caro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0f37m4FhSk)

 Yes, she did falter a bit at some points, but she didn't hype up on the vibrato (common for a lot of child singers). And she still sounded like a child.  

And this is what she eventually sounded like [later on at the age of 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErN8JDGjrHQ). And she's currently studying at a conservatory, with intent to actually to join the opera/classical world. 

Another one is [Aksel Rykkvin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9rvyvssvuI). Like Janeckova, he's studying at a conservatory as well. But he never appeared in any shows, doing conservatory productions and concerts instead. And he sticks to repetoire appropriate for his voice range and age. He's now transitioning into a baritone. 

Personally having grown up listening to Jackie Evancho and Amira Willighagen, I was obsessed with them. I thought that they were literal opera prodigies as the media liked to market them as.  When Laura Bretan came a couple of years ago did I finally swallow the red pill. It was hard, but I took the time to process it and kept an open mind.  Since I follow Classic FM on facebook, not long after Bretan's debut on Got Talent, there were criticisms from professional opera singers. At first I rolled my eyes and went ""ahh snobbish pretentious people as usual"", but I soon realized that having a child sing a full-on operatic aria is the equivalent of having a child go on pointe before she's ready to do so. Nowadays, I still appreciate Evancho and Willighagen, but I have learned to understand what opera really is. And I'm still learning."

To ensure someone is verified: Ask every seller **to comment on your thread** and check that they have Verified Seller or Trusted Seller flair before continuing. If they can't comment, they may be banned. [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSexsells) with any questions about a user. **DO NOT SEND PAYMENT** until you have seen for yourself that a user is verified. A user who offers to verify for you themself on kik/cam/etc may be who they say they are, but there is no way to hold them accountable in the event that they take your payment and do not deliver services.

**Please refer to the [ban list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sexsells/wiki/bans)** before sending a seller payment, especially if they claim to be verified but have not commented on your thread. Many of the ""sellers"" messaging you who will not comment are on this list. 

Please **report** unverified sellers who respond to your buy ads. This is against our rules, and will result in a safer community for everyone.

I’m reply because I was under the same impression.  I have my router in passive mode so that it is simply functioning as a modem off fiber but I have the same problem.  1000 up and 1000 down and all I see at the Orbi is 450 up and 150 down.

"This is a little misleading as literally the next sentence says that operating income in this case doesn't include state and federal appropriations and grants (which is a significant amount of $$ for a public institution). If this is included, the operating loss is down to ~20MM. If you continue to look at the whole picture holistically via Change in Net Position, WWU lost ~$13.8MM in position this year vs gains of ~$22MM and 1.5MM in position from FY 2017 and 2016, respectively. 

They also continue to mention deeper in the doc that this loss in position is due partly to the decision not to raise tuition fees this year to offset rising compensation expenses from COL and other increases. Sounds fine to me, honestly. The school continues to invest in infrastructure and educators while attempting to lower the relative burden the student pays? I'm cool with it."
"Have you resolved this is issue? My V1 cameras started doing this just a couple days ago. I'm not sure why it's doing it now. They're running firmware version 3.9.4.16. The Wyze app is version 2.3.16.

"I was your wife for a few years and it all started with not seeking help for my depression. Despite seeking help and not finding a good fit, I still sought for a job in the food industry but it pays well for all the hard work. Instead of antidepressants, maybe you guys should do something together that will boost confidence as well as encourage her to be active. Something like hiking regularly, going to the gym, taking up a dance class, joining a bowling league, volunteering at an animal shelter. These will all help her meet people, relax, and maybe be more active with her life. Marijuana has helped me with sleep and my life is still a wreck but I'm working on it. I also force myself to get up for my dogs and I'm outside often because of them. A dog isn't my suggestion but she needs a reason to get up, a reason to clean the house, motivation to live. This has to come from her though. Oh, the struggle is real. 
I am grateful for my boyfriend who supported me financially, never really complaining. If it still doesn't work out, you both might benefit from splitting because nobody deserves your situation. You're a good husband."

"In EMS (paramedics, emts, firefighters, etc.) we actually teach to listen to when a patient convincingly says ""I'm going to die,"" or something similar. More often than not, they can just tell their body is circling the drain fast, no matter if they're signs/symptoms are showing as such. Like you said, it's eerie, really. In school, I always thought it was kind of BS but after years of experience, it's definitely a thing. 
  
Of course we always get the overdramatic people who say they're dying or are going to die but like I said, you can tell when they're earnest and when it matters (beyond the extent of signs/symptoms)."

"One month honestly isn't that long to process the grief you're dealing with. It seems like you're worried it will never get better, but one month isn't proof enough of how bad it will be going forward. 

Maybe rebounding? That might not be the healthiest option, but you could try meeting new people in general. New experiences too could be good. Travel or just a new hobby or something? I find just working on goals helps me in my depreesive phases.

It sounds like you're doing some working through this with your counsellor but you also say you spend most of your time distracting yourself. Part of grief is that you have you work through it, so maybe spend some time wallowing honestly? 

Hard to say what will work, but eventually you'll find something that does."

"The West is full.

The UN is trying to overpopulate it, turn it into the Third World.

This Haley does not understand this, they were indoctrinated with giant population ideas.

Canada, with tundra and mountains and Vancouver running out of water, its ideal population is around 10million less than it has right now.

Australia, their ideal population should be half what it has, as it is mostly desert with no water.

The USA, would have to be at least 100million over an ideal population number.  Water, amount of farmland, other resources, very important to remember when the UN and other nuts push for legal mass immigration.

The world has twice as many people as it should.  That is why many suffer, due to stupidity."

"This is bull.  She can have her minor daughter leave school to finish with her ged and homeschool online so that she can actually be the mother to the baby she insists on keeping.  She can inform her that she has to make plans for how to support the baby after she’s 18 because she’s raising her grandchild.  Instead, she thinks she can just unilaterally decide her husband is going to support a baby that isn’t his responsibility while the mom is in college (and who will then be taken away from them at age
5 or 6 when the baby’s mom is “ready.”)

The wife is not thinking rationally and it’s getting in the way of her parenting her actual daughter."

"Look at the video you're replying to and tell me they enforce rules against drivers. Walk outside any NYPD precinct and look at the dozens of officers' personal pickup trucks and jeeps parked all over the sidewalk like a used car lot and tell me they enforce rules against drivers.

Cars kill hundreds of people on NYC streets every year because they drive on sidewalks, speed, and run red lights. Bikes don't even compare. I think it's ridiculous to think cyclists get special treatment when our streets are basically lawless free-for-alls for drivers. The guy in the video had FIFTEEN violations for speeding in school zones and he's still allowed to drive a for-hire vehicle—there is zero accountability and zero enforcement in this city for consistently reckless drivers and it's getting people killed."

"The whole c++ system could be an arcane black box for someone not familiar with it.

Case in point, I wanted to add a simple BP function node in c++. I add the class, compile the **empty** class... 168 errors. Can't find the generated.h file. I try to look online, nothing works.

Frustrated, I downloaded USharp, *compiled it* and without having ever seen how it works, in less than 5 minutes I was able to add a simple spinning script to an object.

I would probably still be trying to fix the 168 errors in c++.

I am not new to programming, but even though I could probably try to refresh my c++ it would take me too much time to get to the same point of expertise I have with c#. 

I want to be effective asap, I don't have time to relearn how to instantiate an object or iterate over an array."

"There's 3 superstars in the league right now.

Then directly just below them is Harden, Kawhi and Giannis. I think those top 6 clearly differentiate themselves from the rest of the NBA but the top 3 are slightly ahead of the other 3.

"I just checked both.

Kerma just doesn't really give numbers on to how the performance is affected.

That's another plus for RaceChip, I'm in Germany. And you're right, they seem to have a bit of a reputation."

I think so too. Tech forums and such are just a group of a very small minority of users. An echo chamber of nerd enthusiasts who overstate the usefulness or uselessness of things. The things people use these voice assistants for are definitely either somewhere in the middle or lower.
I have the opposite issue. Anytime anyone is really sad or depressed I get very aroused and yes it is very annoying. Mostly because people tell me its weird. I just think that it is just normal and maybe you will get over it maybe you wont but for the time being try not to hate it as much.

"This is so relatable. I (23) stopped birth control after 10 years and its my 4th month in and let me tell you my acne came back with an angry force after the first month. Heres somethings ive been doing that helps!

-try cetaphil cleanser. Its very good for sensitive skin and you can use it on other parts of your body and not just your face

-water water water

-try using a toner. I use something simple like half water, half Apple cider vinegar, and a few drops of tea tree oil (for redness relief) and i just spray a couple squirts on a cotton pad.  Moisturize afterwards with an oil. I use a hemp oil i found at tj maxx a while back-nothin special but it works

-also, i just started on happy healthy hippie hormonal balance supplements and i have honestly seen a huge difference in how my skin glows, amongst other things.

I hope this helps!"

There’s a difference between flexing and just looking bad, leaving the stockX tags on your shoes just looks bad. The only reason to leave them on is to show people you spent lots of money on your shoes, and you didn’t.

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsnapchat).

"Not bad, not bad. Fire warriors are some of the best infantry with their s5 guns. I’d recommend Shadowsun, but that’s not surprising. With that many fire warriors, rerolling all misses is pretty powerful. Gotta say, a riptide could be really good against an infantry heavy army, especially space marines. After all, his main gun puts out a lot of shots, and each shot deals two damage, so he kills space marines in one shot. If you dislike the larger battlesuits, maybe you can try building a list around vehicles? Ive never used Tau vehicles myself but they are a decent option."

"Yeah no. Half the time I go through the drive in here they have a ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" print out up.  I think some places are just lazy about it and are probably broken 150+ days/year. 

On top of that, people can't store soft serve in their own freezer, so that may be the reason they went to McDonalds in the first place, upping the aggravation.

Of course I've gone to plenty of random ones while traveling and only have had those be broken 1 in 15 times, so I'm guessing some locations give others a bad name.

That said, I've had literally *zero* times where they've told me I couldn't get a chicken sandwich, fish filet, burger, fries, or a soda. You don't hear memes about that because they reliably serve those. Soft serve ice cream? Not so much. That seems worthy of the meme to me.

I'm with you on Taco Bell though. It's like people posting on Q&amp;A sites asking if Chipotle offers anything that's not super spicy, when the only thing spicy they have is the spicy salsa."
Yeah Friday is special day because theres a special talk in the masjid etc. That's why most middle East countries have that day a national holiday. And since it's Ramadan now it's more special .  And no problem!

"He had some bad shots with KD gone too. Without KD he might get us 15 points, with KD maybe 17.  In a series decided by 6 or less points a game, those two points matter.

"We can get treatment done on a lot of 3 year olds and it doesn't take very long as long as the cavities are minimal. Let the dentist and the staff deal with behavior management. 

They don't need you holding his hands or talking to him to help him through treatment. About 95% of the time parents will only make our job harder when they are trying to 'help'. During the treatment phase it is best to sit in the waiting room or be a silent observer in the corner.

Now, as a parent it drives me crazy to see my kids getting medical procedures completed. I know my kid better than any doctor and it's hard to think that the doctor can get my kid to calm down better than I can. But us dentists do it all day every day. And while every kid is different, kids are all the same. We don't want to hurt your kid and normally we aren't hurting them but we are doing something that is uncomfortable and foreign.

Lastly don't ever say, ""I hate the dentist""  ""I'm afraid of shots"" ""if you don't brush your teeth the dentist will have to pull them out"" I see a lot of small kids that say to me, ""please don't give me a shot"" or ""are you going to pull my tooth?"" if you are positive about the dentist they will be also."

it was the right thing to do the entire century...but people had to be educated out of their ignorance

Besides, while we need accountability and MAM cut, copy and paste pieces that worked for the narrative, I really don´t get the criticism for its genre... I´m thinking in comments that start by ""the so called documentary""

Documentaries are fictional, as a novel based on true facts, it tells a story and select story lines while leaving others behind... This is not a journalistic investigation because it shouldnt be.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is a brilliant Netflix documentary (whose name I forgot) that examine the Russian use of drugs for international athletic competitions... I wouldnt expect it to show Kremlin´s response... It´s one view, not the whole true...

"&gt;Our greatest leaders were centrist for their party.

&gt;Obama  
&gt;  
&gt;Clinton

&gt;Kennedy  
&gt;  
&gt;Reagan  
&gt;  
&gt;FDR  
&gt;  
&gt;All centrist leaders. All great! Because they were able to pass policies on Congress without the shit show we see today happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not saying all centrist Presidents were great leaders:  
&gt;  
&gt;Bush  
&gt;  
&gt;Nixon

This is such a bad read of American politics.

All ""centrist"" dems will eventually realize that there's no working with the current republican party and their abdication of responsibilities to their constituencies. One party is broken, and it's a two party system, so *politics* is broken.

The difference between lefties and centrists is how much time we have wasted in coming around to this realization. Even the New Deal would be considered left of today's democratic party.

If you're a dem, you're left-wing. Period. Enough with all this moderate/centrist bullshit. If you can't approve of the left-wing in the democratic party, then you're a republican. Sorry."

I saw people saying that GoT doesnt have balls anymore because 90% of the cast didn't die during the Winterfell battle. Characters dying for the sake of dying/shock doesn't make a good story or an intense moment. I guarantee you they would've complained if Jon died.

"The person and OP I was replying to credited job creation to demand as if companies have nothing to do with creating that demand. There is a difference between needs/wants, and demands. Demands are created by people/companies producing products that people are willing to pay for, just as much if not more than people shouting from the rooftops that they want something that does not exist.

&gt;They made something better *because they knew the demand was there*.

The demand for the iPhone was was created once people saw how much better it was than their Motorola Razor. That's why smart phone sales sky-rocketed, versus the slow growth from early adopters when there were only shittier products to choose from. So we should credit companies like Apple that take calculated risks, creating and marketing something so much better than what people had, and transforming our society because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

People need food, but do they need chipotle? There was no demand for Chipotle. It was just a good idea that created a ton of jobs. It's not a zero sum game either. Just because chipotle is hiring people, doesn't mean other restaurants are losing employees. The market will decide the equilibrium.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we had suitcases, we would take a sheet and tie it to a stick. There was a need for moving our clothes, but not a demand for a suitcase. An inventor said, here is a better idea. And people agreed and paid him for it. He created that demand. And I don't know why it took so long for a telescoping handle and rotating wheels, but after they came out, we were all like ""why didn't I think of that?"".

&amp;#x200B;

Letting people keep more of their own money so they can build cooler things does result in jobs, and does create demand. That is what's great about free-market capitalism!"

"Eventually, that problem DOES translate to a political problem.  When enough of a nations blood and treasure are squandered on a cause, even in the most despotic nations, governments either back down or are overthrown.  Even the USSR eventually fell to a rag tag bunch of fighters in pajamas.  And that was in a foreign war.  Now imagine that same concept at home here.  How many on the fence Americans would pick a side when their neighbors house is blown up by a hellfire, or the car in front of them takes a Sabot round from a tank?  Insurgent warfare almost inevitably wins by bringing the conflict home, and forcing the populace to choose a side.  We have now been fighting in Afghanistan, with some of the most modern technology in existence, against a group of largely illiterate fighters armed with 50 year old weapons and home chemistry.  And weve been doing it for almost 2 decades now."

I feel the same way with DW sometimes when he tries to break something down. It's a joy listening to Gordon because he's recently out of the car and has a better understanding of the current state of things and will often contradict DW completely. I'd love to see them find a new crew chief who's not far removed from the sport to jump in there with Gordon and Mike Joy.

"Not overly surprising. Can you really expect Japanese artists to conform to US standards of sensitivity without prompting? Especially when their leaders are like this:

https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/tokyo-assemblyman-apologizes-sexist-heckling-female-assembly-member-speech-article-1.1840387

Fucking ridiculous. But yeah, Japan has all kinds of problems with bigotry in a dozen different flavors, sometimes where you least expect it. Most of Persona 5 has some really stand out great character development and reasonable sensitivity towards people with problems, as most of the game's characters do. They're all misfits in someway or another, and most of that's handled great. Then there's one bizarre scene where a character is accosted by an absurdly out of touch stereotype. Totally took me by surprise. I think we'll keep seeing more Cindy-esque foibles in japanese games across the board, not just SE. They're still coming to terms with what it means to treat everyone correctly the same way we are, and as bad as our leaders are, in some ways theirs are worse. 

And honestly, despite Luna and Cindy's parts, I still really enjoyed 15. It was a fun world to explore, and once I'd gotten past the surface I really enjoyed the entourage. Spending days wandering through the wilds, hunting one mark after the next, was just really enjoyable. And I really enjoyed the combat system. Such a joy to bounce from one target to the next, flipping between sword, then spear, the chakram, then shield/dagger, dodging between the crowd to setup combos. Plot could have used help though."

"Dude, you made the right choice. It just got fucking worse. I only ended up watching to the end because right when my friend group finally decided to stop hate watching and actually watch a show we enjoyed they announced that the next season would be the last and since we had already dedicated seven years to that fucking show we decided to finish it. The series finale still fucking pissed me off it was so bad, and I thought my expectations were too low to be disappointed. By the end everyone had magical powers, Sookie was so annoying I wanted to throw something at the TV every time she whined, the plot was a fucking mess that included Bill becoming vampire Jesus and Lafayette being a witch medium, and new characters being thrown at us until the last second. I only paid attention to the last season because a main character was shot in the premiere and I was hoping everyone was going to be brutally murdered and it would end with all of them dead."

"I worked for CVS out of high school.

A woman comes in with a summer tennis ball vercro catch pack.

She wanted to return it, had the receipt, no problem.

Well, 1 problem. See, she bought it in another state with a 1% higher sales tax, so she wanted to get refunded her states sales tax not ours. 

The difference in price? 

4 cents. 

So I call over my manager, explain the situation. 

He looks her in the eyes and saids ""so you want me to give you the 4 cent difference."" 

She agrees. 

So he says ""OK, I just gotta call corporate to get this straighted out."" 

He asked me to help him in the office. 

We have a bin full of loose change(we used to balance the tills) , he takes 4 cents out and puts it on the counter. 

He goes to me ""I bet you a drink she waits at lest 15 minutes for this 4 cents."" 

I'm like, no way. Your on. 

Wouldn't you know that dummy wasted 15 minutes of her life to wait for her less than a nickle. I couldn't believe it.

"I dont think anyone is meant to be anything other than what opportunities they encounter or dont encounter and are exposed to. other than that it might be  what they allow themselves to be. It's about the work you're willing to put in and put up with. 
If you really want to be with someone you will. If it never seems to work out, it may be because some people go after the same types of people over and over. Or it's something with themselves, trust issues and negativity the bring from a former relationship and project it onto the new one. There are many things that can go into play. But noone is meant to be alone, it's all about choices, experiences encountered, grabbed or missed opportunities and what you're willing to do to get in a relationship."

"Our first winter in our first house our furnace kept kicking off. The house got down to about 40 degrees inside before a repairman could get to us and when he took apart the furnace, the first thing he found inside was tons and tons of dust. Whoever installed it hadn’t installed the filter clips properly, so the filter was just leaning up against the inside, filtering nothing at all. 

Under the dust, he found the paper instruction manual for the furnace. 

Under more dust he found that someone had already tried to bypass the overheat safety sensor. Apparently this had happened before, and instead of fixing the problem someone had attempted, unsuccessfully (thankfully!) to bypass the safety. The repairman taught us how to clean out the furnace and reassemble it, we jerry-rigged a new way to hold the furnace filter in place, and haven’t had any problems since then."

"&gt;Luna doesn't even compare if you ask me. 

I'd disagree on this matter. While theres certainly substitutes, theres differences between the 2 to great extents. Dizzy is a utility heavy char, yes, but Luna is a very universally viable and flexible char. She can be run full dps, she can be run pseudo-main dps as a lifestealer. She can be used in literally all content since shes always got S3 element advantage and is rarely squishy enough to be wiped out in a single hit even on disadvantage. 

Dizzy is great for pvp and I dont think anyone was able to predict exactly how godly she'd be for abyss. Great on it but not to this extent. But Luna can be used anywhere and everywhere without some of the drawbacks of C.Lorina like speed and without the heavy spirit altar farming requirement. I'd still give it to dizzy being better just cause I'm blown away at how godly she is in abyss in practice, but I wouldnt say Luna doesn't even compare just because she has substitutes."

"Pretty much :) 

The main thing to understand is that children learn from their parents more than anyone else. That's why physical abuse often can lead to the children being violent themselves, it's what they're been taught. Its the same with the emotional side, if they're shouted at whenever they di the smallest thing wrong, they may shout at others or not do anything for fear of failing."
"I was following along until she supposedly got arrested. Is it legal where you are to record private conversations? Here in CA, it's not, and I have tried to record work conversations in meetings to use with HR but they weren't admissable. Not to mention the five years in prison. My old supervisor was proven to have stolen assets from an entertainment company whose client was the biggest overlord company in the history of entertainment, and he wasn't even fired or slapped on the wrist. I find it hard to believe that someone would get arrested and imprisoned for five years over some jewelry but if that's even close to the truth then I wish I could dish out this level of justice."

"Sometimes it’s worth listening to pundits, especially from a side you disagree with, because it can challenge your conceptions. 

I think abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” to quote what I think was a Clinton policy, and someone who held similar viewpoints was asked by Shapiro “why rare? If it’s just a collection of cells, why shouldn’t it be common?” which really challenged my own views on the matter. I had to step back and really examine my values and where I stood. I’m not bringing that up in order to open a can of worms re:abortion, I’m just saying that while pundits are blowhards they sometimes challenge you in good ways. I’m sure similar things can be said for pundits from the left. 

The danger, of course, is that punditry is part of the circus, and listening too intently might make you a clown."

Update on my post above. My order was for a WOC Black caviar king and a CF jumbo Black caviar king. On 5/5 I got PSP’s of the WOC and the EMS shipping label photo so I could track. I was able to track on USPS almost immediately. It was accepted in China on 5/7. I got text updates each step of the way from the USPS app. I am out of town and got a text today that delivery to my home was attempted. I live on the east coast. So it took 3 days from China which I find faster than when I mail something to my daughter from the east coach to the west coast - both major cities.

"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I think the stress from teabagging/mocking you comes from you focusing on the fact of it happening without recognizing what exactly moves you in this. Let's try to think it through.

Say, you're DPS and got harassed by valkyrie Mercy with a pistol and then finished off by her punch to the face. Mercy then proceeds to teabag you. You get upset. What exactly is happening in your head? Probably feeling something like helplessness and some injustice done your way?

Tell you what, pretend it's Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in your situation. Strong, extremely confident guy playing the game, trying to kill that Mercy with a pistol. Bam, he's dead with a fist, Mercy teabags him. Can The Rock do anything about it? Retaliate in real life? No. Will he be teabagged? Yes.

The truth is - the enemy doesn't know whether they're doing it to you or Dwayne Johnson. They are doing it to someone they don't know. They don't see them as weak or strong or man or a woman - they do it to a character they just killed. They don't know you. Once again, I want to reinforce - you only get upset because your automatic reaction is 1) to assume they're doing it to YOU (as a person that you know very well) and 2) to tie their humiliating action to your perceived weakness. But they have no idea who you are - they will do it to ANYONE in your situation, just because they think they assert dominance this way, while being anonymous and out of reach.

But of course, these actions show THEIR insecurity because a strong, confident person will not need to humiliate anyone else. So please, flip it on its head - when someone does it to you, remember:

1. They don't do it to ""YOU"" you, they do it to the character they just killed - and would pretty much do it to anyone in your situation, even The Rock - and yes, still get away with it! De-personalize it.
2. It shows THEIR insecurity to try and assert dominance this way - and not yours.

Laugh it off, knowing you're better than them - and keep playing."
"Ok, I am 5 foot, and 60 next week. 

I was 225 in January 2017- now 132-135 range. 

Lift. Some cardio is ok (walking a dog), but if want to do this successfully, lift and get a good diet- I went with nutritional keto because I could sustain it- and there is an active weight lifting community that uses keto (keto gains subreddit is awesome) and it doesn’t require special products (meat and veggies) unless you do vegan keto. I also found there are unique life extension benefits to keto, so that was an added benefit. 

The key is know how to leverage mtor to be anabolic and catabolic. That is very much a timing issue- but I won’t blubber about it here. Whether it is keto or some other sustainable diet- the key is that it is sustainable for your budget, taste buds, and lifestyle. My big beef with many programs (Jenny Craig, Weight watchers, ect) is that they are not long run sustainable. So- peek around at diets- find one that you can sustain - keep a food log and a workout log... and you should make good progress. 

Cardio just beats the crap out of your joints and burns glucose. Lifting gets you a longer burn- 24 hours after a session you are still engaged in protein synthesis- and burns fat. So pick your fuel to match which you decide.  You go with cardio- eat glucose and starch. You want to lift? Protein and healthy fats and cut down the sugary starch carbs...

Either way- get the industrial seed oils out of your diet. They burn your arteries worse than smoking (watch Ivor Cummings youtube for more in this)

"It depends on a few factors, really. If your load order is relatively lightweight, there's a pretty good chance that you can get away with just downloading the two main files and any patches you need, and be good to go. If you have a larger load order and any mods that add new NPCs that aren't already patched, then you will likely want to patch them yourself using the instructions on the mod description. If you try just plugging and playing and it doesn't work (and your load order is correct) then you may need to re-run facegen in the creation kit as per the mod page instructions.

I would try just plugging it in, as long as you know how to pick the right patches for your mod list and how to prioritize the plugins so that the patches take precedence."

"Most younger voters I talk to are not interested in Biden. We see his policies as more of the same shit we got from Clinton and Obama. Domestically progressive but essentially corporate centrists. We want drastic change, we want leaders who will address climate change and will take care of our citizens as well as our international relationships. 

One issue facing actual progressives is the media. Even though much of the media supposedly leans democratic, they will always favor the corporate centrists over actual progressives. See airtime for Clinton vs Bernie leading up to and through the 2016 primaries. 

Personally, I have zero interest in Biden. If it comes to it, I will vote for him as begrudgingly as I voted for Clinton three years ago. But I want a real progressive president. I would like to hope that the Democratic Party/DNC sees that the path to the WH in 2020 will require an energizing candidate with the support of the young and minority voting blocs, not another washed up centrist."

"I would do this, seriously. I had a similar issue where I was parking my Model 3 at a large commuter lot with a condo tower being built next door. One day mid-winter I noticed I had tiny specks of what looked like yellow paint on the hood and body of the car. It looked suspiciously similar to the color of the spray-on insulation they used to cover the outside of the concrete frame of the building. Nothing, short of picking at it with a fingernail, would get it off.

I ended up taking the car to a local detailer with a good reputation and they had two guys spend the better part of a day cleaning it off before doing some additional paint correction and then ceramic coating.

In my case I wasn't able to get the developer of the building to take responsibility since there was no evidence to support my assertion that the construction was to blame, so I ended up paying out of pocket to get the car cleaned up. I now avoid that area of the parking lot like the plague as much as possible.

If you can establish a link between the stain on the car, the stain on the fence, and the company that did the spraying then I would definitely go down that path to get them to pay your expenses."

"I adore my child with every ounce of my shitty broken selfish little heart. I was holding him last weekend and crying happy tears just because I'm so happy he's my little boy.

But I want nothing to do with any of the standard hallmarks or duties of being a mom. 

I don't want to bake fucking cookies. I don't want to meal plan and prep. I don't want to vacuum and pick up after him. I don't want to do another human beings laundry.

I refuse to put together another Valentine's day box of cards and treats ""from him,"" when he's not even old enough to read and write, let alone know what Valentine's day is to put together cards for his class. It's farcical. 

Why the fuck I let myself get coerced into doing that this year I have no idea. Each mom did it for their kid and I find the entire thing completely preposterous. 

I find most things about being a mom preposterous. 

I don't relate to other moms, I don't like other moms, and I don't want anything to do with other moms. 

I know I'm supposed to ""find mom friends"" whatever that means.But I don't want to hang out with women with children. 

We have nothing in common except that they're also women with children. 

Which means nothing. It means their uterus works. 

I never liked women with children before I had a child. And that hasn't somewhow magically *poof* changed. 

I don't like women's work. I absolutely loathe emotional labor. I will never be the social mom who does cool things with other kids moms and arranges play dates. My kid is going to suffer and I'm going to have to do my best to mitigate that, but I'm not looking forward to it. 

I want absolutely nothing to do with most of the things that people think it means to be a mom. 

I love my child with my crazy broken heart. But I loathe everything about the entire social category of ""mom."""

"You’re reaching up to the notes and not coming up on top of them. This means you don’t have enough breath to support them, which is why this sounds so faint and breathy - even for falsetto. The tone and notes sound off to me, but I might be wrong. The reverb is forced and spotty, which is most likely a side effect of not having enough breath to support the notes. Why theres a lack of breath I’m unsure of with the context I have, though."

"Yeah, seasons 7 and 8 especially feel so very empty to me. Its not something you notice at first, but theres no *People* around. The cast has been collapsing since season 5 to absurd levels. The Faith/Sparrows storyline in kings landing is one of the earliest encapsulations of this: outside of a couple scenes with random footsoldiers, there are exactly 2 sparrows, lancel and the old guy. And Lancel barely counts since hes never around. They started a trend of ""2, maybe 3, people per scene, no matter what"". Every scene involving the Faith Militant involves JUST the old guy and cersei, or sometimes old guy and margaery. Its everywhere in later seasons, and it makes the world feel so, so empty now. People land on a beach and theres 20 men landing, when before it would have been 100. Look at earlier seasons, and you see one of the 3 main characters in a scene interacting with 2 or 3 other characters during the scene. its not a 3 person conversation, its a 6 person conversation with 3 that matter more. And thats a really important thing to have"

"Ever since hearing about Playboi Carti in 2017 and seeing him join the XXL Freshmen list, I wasn't a fan. I swept his music to the side as some really low-effort and repetitive garbage, admittedly without giving it a real chance. Die Lit comes out and I see it on this subreddit, and since I had recently become an Uzi fan, I checked out Shoota and enjoyed it. Not much else. I didn't give the album any real chance at all. Fantano released his review and, to my surprise, gave it a really positive rating. He said one thing that stuck with me. Something about Die Lit really representing the ""evolution of trap"" and how intoxicating it was in its simplicity, being so adlib heavy with the loopy and almost entrancing beats. That convinced me to check it out one more time. I listened to it while studying for a chemistry test (failed the test), and thought Fantano actually had a decent point. So I came back to it more and more throughout the week, and began to see what other people were saying. Lots of people seemed to think that this was a thoughtful and innovative album, and I could actually really see that. I listened more and more.

Fast forward to today, and Die Lit is my most listened to album of all time. This album is honestly as life-changing to me as an album that isn't intended to be perspective-shifting can be. It transformed the way I approach music and musical innovation and really expanded the range of things I enjoy. I've listened to his music when I've been happy, sad, high, relaxed, or mad as fuck. Die Lit is a fantastic project and I'm really happy that I gave it a second chance. I know it's super popular and well-received now, so I don't need to further bore you with how great it is.

This album would easily comfortably sit as one of my top ten favorite I've ever heard.

**Edit:** Grammar fixing.

Also, my favorite songs would definitely be R.I.P. Fredo - Notice Me, Lean 4 Real, FlatBed Freestyle, Shoota, Pull Up, Old Money, and Choppa Won't Miss."

"Varys has openly said that he’s rooting against Dany now. Tyrion begged him not to, but Varys being Varys refused. From this and from the episode 5 preview, I think Varys is a dead man. And he’ll die for what he believes in, so I don’t think he’ll be taking Tyrion down with him. Dany also told Varys if he betrays her she’ll burn him alive.

Tyrion — while he has made mistake after mistake — I feel like he’s about to do something. I know I’m being optimistic, but Jorah personally told Dany to forgive his mistakes and that his mind is an asset. Him vouching so hard for a man that basically took his place is important imo, so I’m hoping some kind of redemption is coming for his character. 

Peter Dinklage also said his character’s end is very “fitting.” I don’t think fitting = death via Dany."

"key club is like nhs. not unique since most schools have one. founding one at your school imo isn't really that outstanding to colleges; it won't hurt you, but it's still technically not much of a leadership move, but more like a following in footsteps, if you get what i mean. 

unless you're able to explain how founding key club significantly or uniquely benefitted your school, idk. i think instead, you should do a specific type of volunteer and concentrate on that."

"Så, så, pojkar /u/flygandesjuk och /u/ironparrot. Lugn och fin.  


Ni har båda lagt fram påståenden men inte presenterat annat än högst anekdotisk bevisföring. Inte för att låta hård men anekdotisk bevisföring är det samma som ogrundade känsloargument och därmed inte särskilt värdefullt. Man kan inte diskutera hur ekonomisk politik bör se ut baserat på magkänslan. Hursom.  


Flygandesjuk påstår:

\- att majoriteten av arbetskraftsinvandrare är lönsamma 

\- att majoriteten av arbetskraftsinvandrare är kvalificerade, dvs. hög- eller specialistutbildade.

\- att det totala skapade värdet överstiger personens lön via det arbete som utförs. Alltså, ett indirekt påstående om ingen annan som redan bor här hade utfört arbetet.  


Ironparrot påstår:

\- att majoriteten av arbetskraftsinvandrare inte är lönsamma

\- att majoriteten av arbetskraftsinvdrare inte är kvalifierade, dvs. hög- eller specialistutbildade.  


&amp;#x200B;

Dessa påståenden går att någorlunda bevisa genom att besvara följande (jag är säker/ganska säker på att det finns studier eller statistik vad gäller merparten):

  
\- Tjänar majoriteten mer eller mindre än gränsen för att vara en nettobetalare till det offentliga systemet?\* Eller rättare sagt, är populationen som helhet lönsam? Ergo, summan av inbetalade skattekronor minus summan av antal kronor som kvitterats ut från det offentliga systemet. Vanligen delar man upp detta efter ursprungsland men det går också att göra via sektor/typ av yrke.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I vilken utsträckning är arbetskraftsinvandrare hög- eller specialistutbildade? Hur skiljer det sig baserat på ursprungsland, och hur ser trenden ut?

&amp;#x200B;

\- I vilken utsträckning har vi **bevisad** kompetensbrist, inom vilka sektorer, på vilken utbildningsnivå och hur stort intäktsbortfall leder det till? Vidare, vilka eventuella undanträngningseffekter ger arbetskraftsinvandringen (alltså, utfört arbete av någon redan boende här som lika gärna hade kunna göra det).  


&amp;#x200B;

**Föreslagen avgränsning:**

Första generationens invandrare. Maximalt 15 år tillbaka. Framtida intäkter (och kostnader) av migranters barn tas inte med i beräkningen utöver vad som täcks av tidsperioden.  


**Not 1**: Ämnet är komplext, men om ni lägger lite tid på er research skulle era respektive argument tillföra mycket mer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Not 2**: Ni diskuterar läget i närtid, vilket gör att studier alltför långt bak i tiden inte är relevanta.

  
\* Givetvis är detta förenklat, då det är en parameter bestående av en mängd variabler. E.g. lön, antal arbetade år, sjukskrivning, pensionsålder, kön, antal barn och så vidare.  


Gissningsvis kommer ni inte diskutera sakligt per ovan, för att ni inte vet hur ni ska gå tillväga för att analysera ämnet, för att det är för tidskrävande eller för att data saknas.  


**Till sist vill jag komma med en förmaning. Rösta inte baserat på känslor, anekdotiska bevis eller ogrundande uppfattningar. Vi har och har haft tillräckligt av detta under alltför lång tid. Kanske särskilt i frågor som rör jämställdhet, migration och miljö.**"
"Isn't the whole point of having a shield to be defensive so you won't get killed fast?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like majority of people complaining about shields/spears/rapiers are 2h swords users since they can't just spin in the battlefield and get free kills.

Sorry to break it to you all, but shield + spear was literally the most common combo through history in battlefields. Hence the popularity in Frontlines.

In duels you don't see spears so often, why? Cause it makes no sense. But on a battlefield? Yesterday when I saw in enemy team made from randoms literally shield wall in a choke point and random guys trying to stab from behind with spears. That's how it really looked in real life!

It only means that devs made great job at making this game very realistic. And no, there was no balance in real life."

"When my wife and I were looking for a place to get married we went tot his church in our hometown and were asking questions about possibly using the church and the preacher for her services. What it came down to was that she didn't want people just using the church because it was a nice place. In other words she didn't want it to be ""trendy"" I guess. Even though we used this place for many funerals and been to multiple weddings of other people in my family.  

&amp;#x200B;

She asked me if I would be willing to come to the church if she allowed us to use the church for the ceremony. I remember being nervous and thinking she asked if it would be okay If my wife (then fiance) came to the church. In my brain i couldn't fathom anyone asking me to come to a church. Anyway, I said, ""Yes"" and only then did I realize she meant me. SO I told her I would come to a church that I had no intention of going to ever if we could have the privilege of using it for a few hours on a Saturday. I've felt like a dick ever since."

"There's much more to good gear than APR - and since a lot of APR stuff works by multiplier it usually works well to stack it (until you hit 5 per round of course). So your swashbuckler you kit out for absolute melee dps, then you might have a ranged specialist, since bows give you an extra APR off the bat and prevent the use of an off-hand APR booster, you grab Tuigan and get another one, add haste and warrior swings (fighter or archer) and there's your 5 for ranged dps, and if you grab grandmastery in the bow you can pick any weapon for 5 APR.
 
Then you have a casting specialist with Vecna, and you can add the Amulet of Power for even faster casting (Vecna plus AoP plus Alacrity plus Time Stop is probably the most potent combo in the game, you can dump an entire spellbook instantly - and if your last spell is a resting Wish...)
 
Bottom line is multipliers up to caps usually work better if you're minmaxing. For regular play a spread is probably better. The argument against double +APR weapons is APR is itself a multiplier on what the weapons actually do - so it would usually be better to eat the lower APR and pick up a more damaging/higher +/better ability primary weapon - Crom Fayr would improve your DPS more than an extra swing, for example."
So I've done that and so much more. Nothing has worked so I figured I'd ask if you had anymore advice? I can't figure out how I got this to work in the past. I frustrated nearly to tears.

"""Elves and Dragons. Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you.”  the Gaffer

It may seem like a silly or throwaway comment, but this to me sums up the hobbits and a lot of people I know, I live in the American heartland. 

I understand Frodo’s frustration and also appreciation for, well for lack of a better word, short sighted people. People who just want to be left alone, see their kids grow up and have kids of their own. Not concerned (or overly fond of) with things too far off. Grow their gardens, have their Fourth of July parties and thanksgiving dinners. People who as I grew up saw their kids also grow up, go off on their own adventure with the military and never come back. My only regret is there seem to be more Ted Sandymans recently than Gaffers, and Bill Fernys than Butterburs. But they’re my people, for better or worse.

Cabbages and potatoes. Cabbages and potatoes."

Title: **Backed out of selling car**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hi all. First time posting. I was selling my car on Facebook marketplace and had a conversation going with a buyer. Got to the point where we’re talking about a meeting place to do the deal. I never explicitly agreed to the deal and said anything along the lines of “I accept your offer”. I just gave them a public address to meet. While this was going another buyer offered me a higher price. Took their offer instead and messaged the original buyer. He has since threatened to sue saying we had a verbal agreement to sell. Again, I never said anything along the lines of accepting his offer just giving him an address to meet. Is something like this viable for suing on his end? 
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately I panicked and blocked him, deleted the post which deleted our conversation but I do have some screenshots. 
&gt; 
&gt; I’m aware this is probably just to threaten/scare me into having him buy from me but I would like advice. Thanks.

"I had to work 3rd shift for a month at an old job and I didn't adapt to it well at all. I pulled into the neighbor's driveway and started walking up to the door a few times. I just wasn't sleeping and after a 10 hour day at work it was like my brain wasn't forming rational thoughts. For some reason I tried to turn left at a red light too. I have no idea why, I just remember trying to turn and being pissed because the building on the corner made it really tough to see oncoming traffic. Then after a few seconds something finally clicked reminding me you're not supposed to turn left on red. I'm not a dangerous driver, I've 1 speeding ticket for going 72 in a 65 and had a lady back into me while I was parked. Otherwise no accidents and no moving violations.

&gt;One of the things I ask my students is: If you think of a $100,000 salary, and one person negotiates and gets $107,000, and the other doesn’t—what’s the cost of that? ….That $7,000 is compounded. If you and your counterpart who negotiated are treated identically by the company—you are given the same raises and promotions—35 years later, you will have to work *eight more years* to be as wealthy as your counterpart at retirement. Now, the question is: \[negotiating\] over $7,000 may not be worth the risk, but how about eight years of your life?"

"What do you want to do? If you just want to weld in your downtime and still make money at it, just keep on top of whatever is hot on pintrest and sell it on etsy. Figure out stuff you can knock out quick and still have a good margin on. Lots of guys get into welding trailers or smokers and find out that when it's all said and done, they don't make much.

If you're a welder by trade and just want to do more of the same outside of the daily grind, that's mostly going to be legwork and setting up a legit business. You build relations with local companies as an overflow contractor, or do emergency repair work and the like. When they're in a bind, most companies don't give a shot what you charge em, if you're available RIGHT THEN, because it's less than what they may be losing. 

But probably the easiest is making a product, as listed below. Jump on whatever is hot with the Karen's of the world and you'll make decent scratch."

That's a good briefing.

I just consider s7 as an ending. Really. I'm a very easy public, I'm still enjoying GOT despite all this mess.

But True Blood s8e1 was one of the most insulting shit I've seen in my life. I couldn't even watch the rest of s8 and still haven't. Run away ;)"

She got upset at me once because I was next to her and took a screenshot of what I think was an Imgur comment. The phone made the camera click noise for the screenshot, and I just about got in trouble because she thought I snuck a naked picture of her.

Being a security-minded person, I don't want any nude pictures on my phone at all of anyone. Never know what could happen with a portable device that has any sort of storage capability."

"You mean she sacrificed her army and dragons to save the people of Westeros, herself included. The Night King wasn't just an enemy of the north. So many people talking about her sacrifice like the northmen sat inside Winterfell drinking wine and bullshitting while her army fought. This is some of the land she wants to rule over....these are some of the people she claims she wants to save from ""the wheel"", yet she isn't making the effort to know these people at all. She came north, a huge threat with 2 dragons, and when everyone is rightfully cautious of her, she goes around demanding respect and that people bend the knee, then is surprised she finds herself completely isolated from them. The people of Westeros aren't slaves she can free and expect them to worship her out if gratefulness."

"I absolutely loved the feel and atmosphere of this.

I've driven cross country many times, and there really is kind of a feeling of reality getting somewhat fuzzy around the edges on some of those lonely highways. Especially out in the deserts, through Utah, Arizona, Nevada, etc. Once you've driven enough miles without seeing a town or even another car, you start to wonder if the rest of the world has vanished while you weren't looking.

The atmosphere of this episode captured that absolutely perfectly. Like you could one night be driving through the desert, flip your radio to AM out of boredom and curiosity, and wind up driving down this highway without quite knowing what just happened."

"I disagree. What international media perceives to be true doesn’t necessarily mean that it is objectively correct. For example, watching that CNN highlight (not the full video) would lead one to perceive you as a refugee due to persecution of your sexuality, as opposed to the objective truth that It was because you were charged with sedition.


The fact that homosexuals receive death threats/intimidation or is a social stigma is very upsetting. However, it is wrong to conflate these two things together. Homosexuality has been illegal in Brunei for decades punishable with severe jail sentences and was seen as a social stigma (typical of a relatively conservative Islamic society) well before the 2019 SPC.


If you really feel that the Sultan is succumbing to international pressure, we should wait and see if he repeals the SPC in its entirety - boycotts are continuing until then. I would really, really doubt that he will.


It’s pretty clear that you’re ranting a little but your last bit annoyed me. There are plenty of Bruneians (not all) far more intelligent than you or I with a far greater chance of making something of themselves internationally than you or I. Let’s denounce the Bruneians who share those traits, but don’t dismiss an entire population when there are some real gems here. Have some class"

"Here's the thing:Cloak and Dagger in comics started not as superheroes but as murderous VIGILANTES. Their stories were more about Tyrone and Tandy who were kids suffering from PTSD and who they were as people and their relationship with each other.

This show is a sci-fantasy/psychological/social commentary drama  driven by the characters and their motivations and not by the plot. This is a character driven rather than a plot driven show. It's not so much a superhero show as it is a drama about two flawed/damaged individuals who are figuring themselves out as they figure out their super hero roles. If you prefer a more super-hero action plot show, this may not be for you."

&gt;I just bought the HBI K conversion kit for my SBR scorpion. I was planning on getting a 3-lug mount for my Rebel Silencers Defender 9mm can but just talked to them today, they don’t know of a 3-lug adapter that will fit this new line, their older line could use the liberty adapter. Any suggestions on adaptors that might work or how to determine the correct measurements to get a 3-lug adapter to fit? 

You need to ask Rebel Silencers what the mount end of the can is threaded. Your best bet for a 3 lug is going to be a silencer co 3 lug adapter. They are an assembled and contained unit. They require the end of the can be threaded 1.125-28 tpi and 0.50” deep minimum. 

If it is not threaded that spec then I don’t know of any other mounts that would fit. 

See below image for the internal thread spec callout. 

https://imgur.com/Hy9Sbzn.jpg

The red arrow is the portion of the can you need to ask what thread callout they have. 

https://imgur.com/SJQCGNT.jpg

Worst case you can estimate this yourself with a cheap pair of calipers to get the major diameter. Below you can see me measuring my Obsidian Mount , which is the same as sico spec. Here major diameter measures 1.117”. So the female threads that would fit into are estimated as 1.125”

https://imgur.com/q1NOq2k.jpg

Finally you can use a cheap thread gauge to get the tpi (threads per inch). Here you can see I’m measuring the Obsidian as 28 tpi.

"So restarting medication can cause anxiety, I’m on antidepressants and my doctor warned me that my anxiety would get worse for a few days before it got better. And it was definitely worse for the first few days.  

I got through it the same way I used to get through a bad trip... constantly remind yourself that it’s temporary. The feeling doesn’t last. It will go away. You have not always felt like this, and you will not always feel like this. This is not your new reality. The side effects will wear off and you *will* feel normal again. 

I’ve felt that sheer terror before (when a trip goes bad) and I made it out, so I know you can, too. Especially since you know exactly what you’re taking at exactly which dose! 

Have you tried calling your psychiatrist or therapist directly? I have my therapist’s cell phone number and I can call her in case of emergency at any time. This certainly seems like an emergency. If you really feel like you can’t handle yourself, go to the emergency room and they might give you a sedative to help you calm down. I went to the ER for a panic attack and they gave me a Valium prescription. Something like that might be helpful to get you through the medication come up."

Yes: I strive to be kind, diligent and helpful, and those are all qualities I find attractive in a person.

I can’t even be friends with people who disdain and hate them. 

No: I don’t always show it on here but I’m the type who represses everything and then BLOWS UP once I hit my limit. I also get stressed out fairly easily and tend to focus best on one thing at a time (not because I’m mentally deficient but rather because I “zoom in on” whatever it is and forget about other stuff).

"  RIO — **“Sombrou dúvida”** , quarto álbum de estúdio da banda goiana **Boogarins** , chegou às plataformas digitais nesta sexta-feira, com dez faixas, incluindo os já apresentados singles “Sombra ou dúvida”, “Invenção” e “Tardança”. 

  O disco, lançado pelo selo americano OAR (no Brasil, pelo LAB 344), foi gravado num estúdio da cidade americana de Austin, Texas, e teve produção dividida entre Benke Ferraz, guitarrista e cofundador do Boogarins, e o americano Gordon Zacharias. 

  Abaixo, listamos alguns destaques de “Sombrou dúvida”: 

 À frente do próprio tempo
-------------------------

  Um dos grupos mais vitoriosos do rock alternativo contemporâneo, com extensas turnês anuais pela América do Norte e Europa, o quarteto goiano Boogarins costuma estar sempre à frente do seu próprio tempo. 

  Desde que surgiu com as gravações caseiras de seu álbum de estreia, o celebrado “As plantas que curam” (2013), o grupo tem como modus operandi lançar registros com gravações de passados mais ou menos recentes — e, ainda assim, soando para lá de atuais — enquanto já trabalham em canções para um futuro mais ou menos distante. 

  Com “Sombrou dúvida”, quarto capítulo da discografia dos rapazes psicodélicos do cerrado, não foi diferente. O álbum teve o grosso de seu material gravado num estúdio de Austin, em 2017. Na época, os Boogarins estavam na cidade texana para sua segunda passagem pelo cultuado festival South by Southwest (SXSW) — a terceira foi agora em março, com direito a citação na “Rolling Stone” americana, ao lado do Bixiga 70, numa lista de dez descobertas do festival por seu “exuberante turbilhão de psicodelia, pop-rock alternativo e Tropicália vintage”. 

 Invertendo a ordem natural
--------------------------

  Uma das únicas faixas gravadas após esse período em Austin foi exatamente o single “Sombra ou dúvida”. E engane-se quem pensa que o título da música inspirou o do álbum, que faz basicamente uma contração das palavras: foi o contrário. 

  Benke explica: 

  — É a faixa mais fresca entre as dez. Ela foi escrita e gravada muito após termos definido o nome do disco. Tínhamos definido ""Sombrou dúvida"" como nome a partir de uma linha tirada de um dos muitos improvisos livres que fazíamos na casa em Austin onde iniciamos o disco. É um exemplo de como costumamos ressignificar as coisas sem nenhum pudor. 

 Produção mais 'clean'
---------------------

  Em termos de sonoridade, a grande diferença está na produção mais limpa que a do antecessor, “Lá vem a morte” (2017), em que o grupo fez uma espécie de corte e colagem de experimentações eletrônicas com sons caseiros e de estúdio, numa colcha de retalhos neopsicodélica. 

  — “Sombrou dúvida” nasce de um processo de imersão no estúdio, mais próximo do “Manual” (2015), e o resultado é mais *clean* — conta Benke. — Não é como se estivéssemos seguindo uma linha de pesquisa de criação, querendo chegar ao suprassumo experimental. É muito mais um acaso de como as coisas vão se reunindo. No “Lá vem a morte”, eu montava os arranjos gravando, agora montamos todos juntos, tocando ao mesmo tempo. 

 Energia de palco
----------------

  Como resultado desse processo, fica mais impressa a dinâmica de palco que levou os Boogarins a grandes festivais como Coachella (EUA), Levitation (Canadá), Rock in Rio (Brasil e Lisboa) e Lollapalooza. 

  As apresentações ao vivo do grupo costumam elevar a uma nova potência a psicodelia e as experimentações do grupo, subvertendo o lado pop de algumas canções através de improvisações livres propostas pelas guitarras de Benke e Dinho Almeida (que também usa a voz e frases soltas como instrumento) e pela cozinha pesada comandada pelo baixo de Raphael Vaz (que também brinca com seu synth) e o baterista Ynaiã Benthroldo. 

  Esse espírito inquieto é explicitado em faixas como “Sombra ou dúvida”, “Dislexia ou transe”, “Tradição” e “Te quero longe”. 

 Brasilidade
-----------

  Novos elementos, bem brasileiros, entram nas canções, como a viola caipira de “Dislexia ou transe” (tocada pelo músico carioca Bonifrate), o arrocha ácido de “Tardança” (rara canção do baixista Raphael Vaz) e a levada guarânia, típica do sertanejo, de “Desandar” (que quase se chamou “Jorge e Mateus”, tamanha goianice). 

  — Não foi nada muito pensado nesse sentido — garante Benke. — “Tardança” tem uma levada que nem parece canção do Boogarins, talvez mais do Luziluzia *(outro projeto goiano que tem Benke e Raphael na formação)* . ""Desandar"" tinha uma versão do Dinho sozinho, sem batida, meio drone, e fizemos essa levada meio guarânia para ver como ia soar. E gostamos. Tem também uma coisa de chacota, de fazer um sertanejo. A viola do Bonifrate em ""Dislexia"" foi mandada depois, não contávamos com ela quando criamos a música. 

 Versos mais compreensíveis
--------------------------

  Outra mudança, por assim dizer, é que os versos escritos pelo vocalista Fernando “Dinho” Almeida são ouvidos de forma mais clara do que antes. Letras, como define Benke, que demonstram “uma habilidade em falar de assuntos corrosivos de maneira solar”. 

  — São músicas que se você pensar acabam sendo sombrias, mas trazem uma maneira mais tranquila de encarar essa ideia. Nesse disco, fiz um exercício de pensar melhor para para poder expressar do jeito certo sentimentos que temos nesse momento difícil para muitos — afirma Dinho, que mistura referências literárias da juventude com frases soltas que o impactam na “explosão de informações de hoje”. 

 Não é coincidência
------------------

  Acompanha a cena indie brasileira e notou algumas coisas familiares em “Invenção”? É que a melodia do refrão foi usada na faixa-título de “Princesa”, segundo álbum dos também goianos do Carne Doce. Dinho é coautor da canção, ao lado da vocalista e compositora Salma Jô. Ele também assina duas faixas do mais recente disco do Carne Doce, ""Tônus"": ""Brincadeira"" e ""Amor distrai (Durin""). 

  Além disso, a bateria de “Invenção” foi sampleada de “LVCO 4”, canção do álbum “Lá vem a morte”, do próprio Boogarins. 

 Pé na estrada
-------------

  Disco na praça, é hora de rodar. O Boogarins, que faz uma média de 100 a 120 shows por ano, estreia “Sombrou dúvida” no Circo Voador no próximo dia 7 de junho, e até o fim do mês passa por outras capitais brasileiras. Em julho, segue para a Europa, com 12 datas em quatro países, antes de seguir para os EUA, em setembro."

"First question: What do you want to do long-term? Be a stockbroker or give people advice on personal finances? Like everyone else has said Option 4 gives you a decent base salary and benefits, but TBH I don't love any of these options for a new grad. Here's why: If you want to sell people stuff they likely don't need, and hit sales quotas and commissions based on flavor of the month mutual fund/ins. product/annuity/credit card etc, AND you have a large network of fairly affluent people who will buy from you....sure. But seriously think about it and let's break this down:  


 In option1...10 Accredited clients means 10 people with $1 million of investable/manageable assets (likely outside 401(k), who will say to someone in their early 20s ""here you go manage my money""- possible yes, but likely? No.   


Option 2 - ""advisory firm"" where you're 100% commission - I wouldn't call than an advisory firm, I would call than a churn and burn sales job. Not that much different than #1.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 4- Helping clients make decisions at a bank - sounds decent on the surface, but a college degree in finance with in-house training isn't the level of knowledge you need to seriously say you can independently help people - there's CFAs with years of experience out there you'd be competing with, not to mention really this is another version of # and #2 where ""helping clients"" likely really just means completing some sort of generic questionnaire about risk tolerance and using the score to place them in one of the bank's proprietary mutual funds and/or something that pays the bank revenue (maybe not even a direct commission to you). 

&amp;#x200B;

If I was in your shoes, I would take #3 as a backup because at least you have a base salary that is not dependent on selling people things they don't need and gives you an opportunity to learn something about the business. In a year you could apply to other roles. To be completely candid, I would keep looking and only take this as a backup. If you want to be a financial advisor, then you need to find an entry-level analyst position at a real financial planning firm with the understanding that nobody doing real financial planning is going to let you be the lead advisor in a client relationship, but if you want to grow into that, it is 100% possible to find an analyst role where you shadow client meetings first few months, have client interactions, and eventually learn to be a lead advisor. 

  
What you're going through in recruiting is completely normal, here's a video by a great young advisor I think will give you some context:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4d9q492qgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4d9q492qgM)"
"I think everyone agrees that it is completely expected for Dany to be super pissed and act out in a emotional rage. Understanding what has happened to her this is in fact a normal response. I would say about 75% of people have always thought of Dany as a good person who has helped people and made some questionable decisions along the way. The other 25% (I am in this group) think Dany has been going crazy from the very beginning and this is not coming as a shock at all and in fact I thought it was going to happen before now. The people are very divided about her past actions and what it actually represented.

I say that in s2 when she arrived at Qarth to a strangers city and within 30 seconds said she was going to come back and burn the city down that to me is a ""mad person"".

Many other people think her actions were completely justified and she has done way more good than bad.

It is up to each of our subjective opinions now and I think D&amp;D did a very good job showing us a slow decline into more and more morally questionable decisions and the story is about to hit its final moment in that arc. Obviously many people here do not feel that way."

"&gt;  But is this a case of garbage in garbage out, or might the results still be fairly reasonable? 

It really depends on the circumstances (like what the 'true' model is) -- just as it does with a frequentist. If you ask an equivalent broad question to this one of a frequentist, there's not much can be said there either, until you get much more specific about what the true situation is and how far out what you're doing is. 

If you specify the correct situation, you can investigate the effect on the posterior of the quantitiy of interest of using the wrong model in any of a number of ways (I'd be inclined to look at simulation to start, just as I would with a frequentist model).

There's many things a Bayesian might say on questions of model misspecification, but I'll focus on some common, practical things that might typically be done in a fairly ordinary take on a problem.

It's possible to robustify Bayesian models - most easily by extending them (to broaden your classes of assumed distributions\*, to generalize the form of relationships between variables and so on).

\* e.g. if we take a less obviously wrong model, so we did something more like a Bayesian might do, which is to treat binary data with binomial assumptions (conditionally, independence and constant proportions); you might end up doing a Bayesian logistic regression, say (though there are many other possibilities), and a prior that's not *obviously* wrong. 

Now either or both of those assumptions to apply a binomial model could be wrong. Let's take the assumption of conditionally constant p (that is, given a set of x-values, the P(Y=1) is constant).

What if that's wrong and we have heterogeneity of proportion? A Bayesian can just choose a reasonable model for that heterogeneity and keep going (e.g. you might assume a beta-binomial, or you might instead choose some finite mixture - say specifying that there are two components\* in the population). With modern methods, it's often *easy* to do something like this. 

What we did is broaden the class of models for $p$. We end up with something that is less reliant on the assumptions -- it can model a variety of kinds heterogeneities of proportion reasonably well, and so a substantial proportion of the impact of assuming homogeneity will go away, even if the extension itself is not a perfect description either. 

You might then add in components for an outlier process, or some kind of serial dependence or whatever else as needed. You might put hyperpriors on your priors. 

This sort of ""replace a component of a model with a more general one"" is common, and often not difficult to do (it's typically much harder for a frequentist to do that in any kind of nontrivial situation)

\* there can be some issues with 'unobserved' components like this that can crop up, which present interesting problems to deal with in some situations, but the beta-binomial approach is relatively straightforward."

"This AD deal is a potential disaster. It leaves us with zero cap to work with, and at a ridiculous price for a 1-year contract. No big 3 has ever fielded such a shallow roster. We'd be left with no path to add support, literally all we'd have are scrubs and minimum vet ring chasers. Praying we get useful guys to play cheap for us is not a legitimate strategy.

Unless we can hold off for 2-4 months to trade our current contracts for bigger ones, the deal will leave us with no supporting cast, and no players to make any trades. It's pretty much only worth it if we can keep a few players for depth / other trades. We need 3 other guys worthy of playoff minutes before letting vet minimums fill out the rest.

The Heat, a superior big 3 with Lebron at his prime, needed guys like Chalmers, Battier or Ray Allen to win, and just barely did. They failed their first year because the supporting cast was such garbage, their one extra signing ($5m for Mike Miller) didn't turn out well. If we get unlucky with injuries and one FA plays poorly, there's a chance AD straight up leaves because of all the trouble we'd have. Too much risk and little chance of payoff, at least if we make the trade immediately as everyone suggests."

"From reading [this article](https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly), my impression is that utility companies have to pay ""franchise fees"" for the privilege of digging underneath a city's streets. If the city gives out only a single monolithic franchise for its entire territory, the single monolithic company that is able to buy that franchise and deliver all the necessary service seems a bit like a state-sanctioned monopoly.

From that article:

&gt; When monopoly did appear, it was solely because of government intervention. For example, in 1890 a bill was introduced into the Maryland legislature that ""called for an annual payment to the city from the Consolidated [Gas Company] of $10,000 a year and 3 percent of all dividends declared in return for the privilege of enjoying a 25-year monopoly. This is the now-familiar approach of government officials colluding with industry executives to establish a monopoly that will gouge the consumers, and then sharing the loot with the politicians in the form of franchise fees and taxes on monopoly revenues. This approach is especially pervasive today in the cable TV industry.

&gt; Legislative ""regulation"" of gas and electric companies produced the predictable result of monopoly prices, which the public complained bitterly about. Rather than deregulating the industry and letting competition control prices, however, public utility regulation was adopted to supposedly appease the consumers who, according to Brown, ""felt that the negligent manner in which their interests were being served [by legislative control of gas and electric prices] resulted in high rates and monopoly privileges. The development of utility regulation in Maryland typified the experience of other states.""

And:

&gt; More recent economic research supports Gray's analysis. In one of the first statistical studies of the effects of rate regulation in the electric utilities industry, published in 1962, George Stigler and Claire Friedland found no significant differences in prices and profits of utilities with and without regulatory commissions from 1917 to 1932. Early rate regulators did *not* benefit the consumer, but were rather ""captured"" by the industry, as happened in so many other industries, from trucking to airlines to cable television. It is noteworthy — but not very laudable — that it took economists almost 50 years to begin studying the actual, as opposed to the theoretical, effects of rate regulation.

&gt; Sixteen years after the Stigler-Friedland study, Gregg Jarrell observed that 25 states substituted state for municipal regulation of electric power ratemaking between 1912 and 1917, the effects of which were to *raise* prices by 46 percent and profits by 38 percent, while reducing the level of output by 23 percent. Thus, municipal regulation failed to hold prices down. But the utilities wanted an even more rapid increase in their prices, so they successfully lobbied for state regulation under the theory that state regulators would be less pressured by local customer groups, than mayors and city councils would be.

California utility prices are controlled by [a state commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission).

The San Francisco city government [says](https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/3226-PGE%20Franchise%20Fee%20Audit%20Report%20-%20FINAL.pdf):

&gt; In 1939 the City granted Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) and its successors two franchises to use city streets to transmit, distribute, and supply electricity and gas. In consideration for the two franchises, PG&amp;E agreed to annually pay the City a percentage of PG&amp;E's gross receipts from the sales of electricity and gas in the City.

This franchise fee totaled 11 million dollars over 2009 and 2010 combined, out of 1.8 billion dollars in gross receipts."

Also, since everyone else has really said what there is to say I'll chip in with the fact that I don't really like makeovers where so many of the queens just use homemade/premade outfits and just slap em on each other and go. I think it's kind of against the spirit of what made the earlier season makeovers interesting. I really hope it doesn't continue to be the standard, otherwise the challenge just might as well not exist."

The mark of a great coach is the ability to win consistently with a mediocre or slightly above-average roster. A great coach can make a bad team competitive.

"I was considering putting Olimar with Pichu and Wolf, but there aren't enough Shulks to justify that. 

As far as the winrates, I just don't trust them. High winrates are a combination of a character being good, and being found out. Wolf is probably the most explored/found out character in the game, so at this early point in the game he's a good choice. For a while a few months ago, a lot of top players picked up wolf and people were still figuring the matchup out, so it explains his winrate inflation. I expect it to go down over time. But yeah, obviously that's a very good winrate and he's still top tier for me, just not 4th

Also, Wii Fit is 64 on that list. Clearly, she's very unexplored atm and that's why her winrate is so low, because she definitely has the sauce to be a good character. Marth is also 57, because basically no serious player uses Marth, even though he's much better than that. Obviously, result stats are flawed in smash"

The guest items dude who was warning them to not say it out openly, praised this ibn al-hussain guy as being knowledeable on that shiachat thread, look at what this guy types about how exactly sunnis are viewed in shiaism.

""

Shiachat user: Ibn al-Hussain

The notion of interfaith or interreligious dialogue or *unity* is a modern phenomenon that sprung out of the modern secular state. For much of human history, there was no concept of interfaith or interreligious unity, because it made no sense to be on good terms with someone you fundamentally and theologically disagreed with and considered them to be hell-bound. The mainstream Shi'I theological view is no different. You can pick up any scholar from the classical period, up until recently with the likes of Sayyid al-Khu'I and Imam Khomeini, and you will find that everyone (minus perhaps a few reformist scholars in contemporary times) believed that Sunnis, in reality, are like disbelievers and polytheists, whose actions are not accepted and we only treat them as Muslims apparently in this world. In fact, Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani went as far as to say that Sunnis are Najis even apparently. This was a basic theological premise that scholars of a religion had regarding others (including Sunni scholars towards us). This theological premise then, of course, begins to show in your jurisprudence when it is allowed to backbite the Sunnis because they are not considered our brothers and believers - *mu'min* (many jurists believe this ruling to be from the necessities of our Fiqh - the only major jurist who was against it, as far as I know, was Muqaddis Ardebelli and he was pretty much a Sayyid Kamal al-Haydari of his time and jurists like Sahib al-Jawahir critiqued Ardebelli very harshly), it tells you to not physically defend them in a jihad if they are being attacked (because it will result in you in aiding misguidance), it allows you to accuse them falsely and condemn or curse them, and as a matter of fact it leaves no room for you to discuss ""unity"" with them."

"You raise a good point, which is that if a country is truly becoming uninhabitable, its military will start swinging its dick around.  This means war with the US, essentially.  But the US also has the best military on earth, by a very large margin.  If the Mexican military really tried, it could delete a lot of life from Texas, Arizona, etc.  But the US would be able to do the same x10 in return, and Mexicans would still have to deal with the decentralized militias that occupy all corners of the rural US.

The only way the US loses in such a scenario is if the virtual rest of the world got together and consciously decided to end it.  I just don't see that happening, but I guess it's possible.

&gt;Despite the obsession as you rightly pointed out with race that exists among a certain subsection of the US population, that subsection is likely to decrease as a percentage of the population as time goes on, as it has been doing. 

This part is delusional.  Race issues in the US have not been fading out, they have been accelerating.  This is because people become more racist when resources are scarce.  In addition, white Americans have lived what are probably the easiest, most unsustainable lives in the history of humankind: it is a certainty that white America will become more racist as time goes on, consistent with the 2012 - 2016 trend."

"To go straight cynical - one of the reasons we were told we weren't getting raid tier sets anymore is that it allowed them to instead make more variety of raid sets.

Now, BFA - 3 mythic/elite sets, 3 non mythic/elite sets, = 6 sets then a few recolours.

"From the posts and comments you spend on average $190/month on the car, plus having spent $130 on repairs. If you’re paying half of the car price then she should pay half of these costs. Over six months that equates to $95/month plus $65 one off costs for a total of $635. So pay her the remaining $265 and make her pay half of all costs from here on in. If she doesn’t like that idea then tell her to shut up about the initial cost. If she complains about the fuel you use getting to and from work, then remind her that she benefits from that too with the money you earn that goes to her."

""Oculus is still offering it"" - are you trying to paint Oculus offering cross-buy as a *bad thing?*

""Steam doesn't allow"" \**deep breath*\* - because Steam only runs on PC platforms. When it comes to Steam, a game is a game is a game. Steam = Steam = Steam. There is only one. When it comes to Quest, you have to re-design the entire game, compile it for a completely different instruction set (Quest doesn't even run x86) with drastically different performance requirements. Under the hood, every single Quest title is completely and *drastically* different from its PC counterpart. The fact that cross-buy even exists in a scenario like this *at all* is straight up amazing. Given the work it takes to bring a PC game to Quest, every fucking dev has every fucking right to charge full price again. The fact that so many choose not to deserves praise.

And you're trying to come up with some convoluted, asinine line of reasoning for why all of this makes Oculus bad. Give me a fucking break."

"This is it for me. You can't stay fat if you don't eat. I will wean myself down to 1350 -1500 calories a day and the weight comes off whether I'm active or not.

I do walk a bit and am going to get back on my bike if it ever stops freaking raining. I still play hockey too. It all helps, but until you learn to count calories (it's easy because the info is literally everywhere) you won't lose weight. First thing is cut out the alcohol. Those are stupid calories to anyone keeping track. Once you learn how to budget your calories you'll make trades where if I eat that now, I'll have to go with a filling but low cal meal later. I enjoy new and different things since I changed my eating habits. That's the other thing-it's not a diet, it's a lifestyle change, if you want to do it."

"The poison (venom, more specifically) those animals create is necessary for their survival. That's how they disable or kill their prey so that they can eat. It is also how they protect themselves from predators.

Humans have access to antivenom that can help us to survive if we're exposed to certain types of venom, but most spiders, snakes, and scorpions aren't particularly lethal to humans anyhow.

"When I moved here, I used a scooter/Vespa nearly every day for 3 years before upgrading to a motorcycle. It's a really, really good option and here are my thoughts.

* Treat it like it is a motorcycle (because it is). Take all the training classes (look up MSF classes), get licensed appropriately, and get the gear. Get gloves, an armored jacket, boots, and a full face helmet. 
* Don't buy an actual Vespa. There are plenty of other brands out there and when you buy a Vespa, you're paying for the name. Look into Buddy scooters or visit Scooter Dynasty in DTLA. 
* Ride vigilantly and defensively. Even with proper training and gear, you're still at very high risk. 
* Park safely. Try to park it in a garage or otherwise secured area if possible. If you can't at minimum get a heavy duty lock and try to chain it down if at all possible."

"This is why I don't bother making friends in college. I met one person that I'd consider a true friend, everyone else are just people I talk to in class occasionally. Mate I don't know anything about you but if you're an introvert trying to twist yourself into someone who can fit in at parties you're wasting your time. If you want to make lasting friendships you gotta look for them while you do the stuff you love to do. All my real friends are online all over the world because my hobby is playing video games and participating in fandom. That one friend I made that I mentioned? She's big into fandom as well, that's why we hit it off. College is isolating and meeting people is incredibly hard even though you're surrounded by people who are just as lonely as you are. The only advice I can really give is to do the stuff that makes you happy and don't limit yourself to the people around you, especially if those people are trying to make you into someone you're not."

"This is me! I have terrible veins even when I’m prepared for blood draws. One story in particular was truly horrifying and has led to a deep hatred of needles, hospitals, and nurses. 

I was hospitalized once. I had an allergic reaction to my IV (swelling, itching, etc.) so they had to remove it. However, they wanted to do a color contrast MRI, so a new IV was necessary. While trying to reinsert the IV the nurses (6, in total, way more than 2 pricks each) basically treated me like their own little practice doll. I explained over and over that they weren’t going to get one because I was dehydrated (they thought I would be having surgery at some point so I hadn’t had water or food in over 30 hrs). 

This didn’t stop them. They blew veins in from wrist to shoulder. One nurse decided to try the inside of my upper arm. Not just try, but dig. He dug around in the inside of my upper arm for at least 30 seconds. My best friend was there. She said she had never heard a scream/sob that made her gut lurch like the one that came out of me. She jumped up and basically told them to fuck off and stop torturing me.

They tried to get an ultrasound guided one, but the nurse who did it just didn’t feel like coming up to do it. They finally got paramedics (god bless them) to come up to the room to try. They never pricked me, but looked all over my arms and legs for 20 minutes. Eventually, they turned to the nurses still in the room and said “Yeahh there’s no way. She’s too dehydrated and you’ve blown any good veins she has left. You can’t do the MRI.”  Cue my doctor. 

She comes in and is immediately horrified because her 25 year old patient is laying there sobbing, covered in bruises. She, of course, asks what’s wrong. The nurses inform her that I took out my IV (wtf?) and that they couldn’t get one back in for the color contrast. My friend (god bless her too) immediately corrects them, explaining that the nurses took it out because of the allergic reaction. Sure enough, the dr checks my arm where the old IV was. “I’m not a dermatologist but I know an allergic reaction when I see one.” The dr asked them why they didn’t get her or let her know the IV was out. There was some grumbling about the MRI and whatnot from the nurses. Finally the dr says “You should know we can get an image without the contrast, it just won’t be as clear.” She then apologized to me on behalf of the nurses and personally gave me antihistamines for the reaction. 

The nurses never apologized."

"A bonus vote for a class system here, preferably closer to Tactics or FFV. I find that the FF games with class systems were among the most fun/replayable from a pure gameplay standpoint.

At the very least, I don't want a lead character that is locked into being some kind of sword fighter. I want to play as an archer or white/black mage lead for once (there were prior single player FFs that let you do this, but they were released like a decade ago at this point), though the highest chance of this happening would be through a class system. Choices are always good."
Wow Wildest Dreams sounds like it’s straight off of BTD. Only if Lana sang it and made it sad. And called someone daddy cause she was super into that back then.
"I disagree. Loot boxes change the incentives for developers and players. They exploit players to keep then playing and try to keep something desired enough out of reach whereby some percentage of the player base will end up paying a lot of money. The debris are looking to hook the ""whales"" who provide a highly disproportionate amount of the revenue and the game mechanics are modified such that they can squeeze out more money.

I think it's highly predatory and results in games that are mostly busy work while giving the illusion of some sort of productivity or filling of a collection. The amount if time and money spent by the player drives more of the success than any skill, which sets these types of games apart from more traditional ones."

"I had a high school Calc teacher I loved because she actually treated us as adults and equals. She didn’t put up with bs and wasn’t scared to call us out if we deserved it. 

She was also the head of the honor society at our school which I was in but got kicked out for missing 2 meetings. The day I missed the second one I walked into class early and she just looked at me with her arms up in the air and went “what the fuck man.” That’s when I realized I was gonna be kicked out and got kinda freaked out about getting into college and whatnot. She was super reassuring that I was gonna be fine and get into the school I wanted. She was a mama bear who just wanted the best for her students and would use some tough love when necessary."
"Ah, good point. Also, it isn't always needed to be x=10 or more sometimes just getting enough for Great Oak and swinging the crew is enough. Depends on board. Love Finale."
"While the idea is cool, this character essentially has no abilities late game. Once you’re kitted, all 3 abilities become pretty useless. Sure you could store a bunch of throwables in the safe, but do you really *need* to? 

Seems great for early game and useless late, which no other character is guilty of.

Personally, I think any character based around loot is a step in the wrong direction. Even Lifelines package is kinda dumb since it’s nearly useless late."

"A lot of people view life choices as mistakes. As a Catholic I was taught about repentance and forgiveness. I would go to confession and do whatever it was that was need as penance. One day I was thinking and it occurred to me that while yes I have made mistakes and I will continue to mess up that what is really needed is not for a priest to absolve me of my sins, but for me to be able to forgive myself and not remain a slave to those sins or the sins I may or may not commit in the future. God is not punishing you, God loves you. But the more you look back the more power you give those sins, the more preserved they are in the pillar of salt. Look forward, move forward and remember in Christ all things are possible."

"Hill people gear kit bag.  Sounds like it could be perfect for you. I've been using one for a few years while hiking - so I have a backpack or child-carrier on and the idea is to make it not interfere with a fully kitted pack. So the Kit bag is a chest pack, they have a few different sizes, and for your situation as I understand it may be perfect because you can use the other pockets for carrying the other stuff you may want to be convenient but when you need the gun it's EXTREMELY quick to access and present to the target.

"&gt; ""Are you for Medicare for All or are you on the side of Big Pharma and the insurance industry?""

&gt;That is the fundamental question advocacy group Our Revolution intends to pose to Democratic lawmakers across the country with its nationwide ""Medicare for All Emergency Ambulance Tour,"" which launched Thursday with the goal of pressuring members of the House majority to support Rep. Pramila Jayapal's single-payer legislation.


&gt;To underscore the life-or-death urgency of passing Medicare for All, Our Revolution members plan to drive an ambulance to the home offices of House Democrats who have yet to sign on to Jayapal's Medicare for All Act of 2019.

&gt;The nationwide tour kicked off Thursday in the Maryland district of House Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a long-time opponent of single-payer."
"I got so confused, actually. I was good on the fingerings when I knew the string, but then it went to a dark place for me in introducing the 0-3 notation. Otherwise, the game was incredibly easy. My piano experience definitely helped; having to memorize both clefs makes treble-only so easy. My top score is 160 after the second go-around. 

I definitely need to work on correlating the entirety of first position to the treble clef."

"One day, everyone stopped having powers.

Flying people instantly fell to a most likely demise, those with super strength were crushed under the weight of the cars they held, invulnerable people got instantly reacquainted with mortality.

Most people are baffled as to why it happened, and everyone is still struggling to readapt. I know what happened.

I caused it.

You used to be able to invest and sell your powers at the stock market, dont ask me how that worked, and my power was actually pretty useful. I could shoot bubbles from my fingers. You may think that means I could capture people in giant bubbles or cause serious eye irritation, you would be wrong.

I caught a guy trying to rob a bank, and trying to test out my newfound abilities. He carried a 300 pound safe full of money over his head. I ran out from behind the corner and screamed ""EAT SOAP BITCH!"" And a laser shot from my hands.

It hit the robber, and he was crushed under the weight of the safe instantly. I thought that was weird since my power was bubbles, but it worked fine enough... Until some guy fell and hit the ground hard.

Crushings, fallings, and all sorts of hyperbolic accidents happened in the next hour. I hid in my house and tried to ignore it all. I decided to check the market to see if any juicy markets sparked up, and saw nearly 500 pages of powers disappear.

And that's how it happened. Everyone lost their powers because some dipshit caused an economic bubble and nobody could afford it anymore."
